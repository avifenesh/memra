# bw24 on H100 — the serving lane (sm_90a)

> **Merged into main 2026-07-30** (`lane/unified-engine`): one tree serves both arches,
> auto-detected at build (`BW24_CUDA_ARCH` overrides). This ledger stays append-only.

Companion to `ARCHITECTURE.md` (the sm_120 laptop engine). This document is the
architecture for the **H100 serving lane**: multi-tenant, batched, lane-scheduled
serving with every kernel driven to its sm_90a wall. It folds in three ground-truth
maps (crate architecture, full kernel inventory, lane design) and the
2026-07-25 engine-decision bench. Perf claims follow the repo law: N=5 medians,
kernel-check + argmax gates before any measurement.

Validation box: rented cloud instance, 1×H100 80GB SXM (driver 595.71, nvcc 13.1),
SSH per the private ops runbook (lifecycle + dead-man switch live there).

---

## 0. Hard facts (what changes vs the sm_120 doc)

1. **sm_90a is the inverse of sm_120.** H100 HAS: wgmma (async warpgroup MMA),
   TMA, 228 KB smem/SM opt-in, clusters, FP8 tensor cores via cuBLASLt, 132 SMs,
   3.35 TB/s HBM3. H100 LACKS: the sm_120a FP4 block-scale mma kinds
   (`mxf4nvf4`, `kind::f8f6f4` is sm_100a+ — f8f6f4 REFUTED on 90a by ptxas,
   commit aa8b51d). Everything gated on `mxf4/f8f6f4` stays dead here; everything
   gated on tcgen05 stays dead everywhere (that's sm_100a).
2. **The portable int8/bf16 MMA already in-tree runs on sm_90a.**
   `mma.sync.m16n8k32.s8`, `m16n8k16.s8`, bf16 `m16n8k16`, `ldmatrix`,
   `cp.async` are sm_80-class PTX. The 90a build disables them by **Rust-side
   gate only** (build.rs "portable boot" decision), not silicon:
   - `legacy_quant_gemm_allowed = !portable` → `crates/memra-engine/src/lib.rs:65-70`
   - `mmq_supports` → `false` on portable → `crates/memra-engine/src/mmq_ffi.rs:194`
   - `try_fp8_gemm` → `Ok(None)` on portable → `crates/memra-engine/src/fp8_ffi.rs:96`
   - FA prefill → `sdpa_naive` (single-thread softmax oracle) → `lib.rs:5580-5583, 5625-5631`
   - GDN chunked prefill compiled out → `cu/hybrid.cu:420`
   - NVFP4-W4A8 → link stub on portable → `build.rs:118-121` (main arm is
     m16n8k16.s8 — candidate for re-enable; f8f4 arm stays dead)
3. **Measured baseline (2026-07-25 bench, Qwen3.5-9B Q8_0, N=5 medians):**
   decode 181.2 tok/s (dp4a, 51% of 352 tok/s weight wall) — already 101% of
   vLLM 0.26 w8a8 single-seq. Prefill ~398 tok/s vs vLLM 35,000 (88×): that gap
   is the fact-2 gates, i.e. the documented dp4a-fallback class ("298 vs 1413
   pp512" — lib.rs:5620-5624), not a kernel-quality mystery.
4. **The engine is architecturally B=1.** One `Cache` ("Single sequence",
   cache.rs:4), one recurrent GDN state (hybrid.cu:3 "n_seqs=1"), FA decode Q =
   `[head_dim, n_head, 1]` (flash_attn.cu:1779). bw24-server exists (axum +
   GPU-worker thread) but multi-sequence = time-interleaved B=1 steps
   (worker.rs:277-288, MAX_ACTIVE=4, private cache per session). Token-batching
   exists only along ONE sequence (spec verify m=2..16, prefill m≥16) — the
   m-tier dispatch in `Engine::matmul` (lib.rs:3894) is the seam cross-sequence
   batching rides.
5. **Spec-exactness law carries over**: decode must stay bit-identical to the
   sequential oracle at every m (the verify tier already obeys it). Batched
   paths inherit the law; graphs bake device counters (decode.rs:17-23) so
   batch geometry changes mean re-capture, never silent reuse.
6. **The lane model is measured, not aspirational** (lane batteries B2/D1/D4):
   interactive = protected + IS the SLO sensor; judge (prefill-shaped 2048/4)
   sheds at 100% of SLO; harvest (decode-shaped 64/256) sheds at 90%. Shed
   happens OUTSIDE the engine (429 + Retry-After), never queued inside. The
   headline defect a native engine must fix: vLLM's ONE global chunked-prefill
   budget (2048) taxes baseline interactive p99 11.6→40.6 ms even at zero
   parasite load. Native answer = **per-lane prefill budgets**.

---

## 1. Target: what "done" means

An engine that on one H100:
- serves interactive streams at p99 TPOT ≤ 50 ms while judge+harvest lanes ride
  the dark compute, with **per-lane admission and per-lane prefill budgets
  native in the scheduler** (not proxied through a global knob);
- decodes batched: B sequences share every weight read (QKV/O/FFN as m=B GEMM),
  attention per-sequence over a paged KV pool;
- prefills through tensor cores (target TTFT ≤ 300 ms @ 2048 tok, ≥ 60× today);
- decode single-seq reaches 95-98% of the 352 tok/s weight wall via the wgmma
  lane (334-345 tok/s, = ~1.9× vLLM B=1);
- every kernel in `cu/` has an sm_90a tuning verdict (kept / re-tuned / replaced)
  with before/after N=5 numbers;
- shared machinery (KV pool, lane scheduler, sampling, launch helpers,
  validation harness) extracted into crates the sm_120 lane can also consume.

---

## 2. Phase A — un-gate the portable tensor-core paths (days, ~5× prefill)

No new kernels. Flip the fact-2 gates behind an arch predicate
(`portable_boot` → `hopper_mma`) and validate each step on the box:

| Step | Change | Expected effect | Gate |
|---|---|---|---|
| A1 | Allow `qmatvec_gemm_q8_0` (int8 m16n8k32.s8) on 90a: lib.rs:65-70 + gemm_supports lib.rs:5629-5645 | prefill matmuls leave dp4a class (repo analog: 298→1413 pp512) | kernel-check + argmax MATCH + pp512 N=5 |
| A2 | FA prefill bf16 mma path on 90a (lib.rs:5580-5583): `fa_prefill_f32_pp`/`_qw` replace sdpa_naive | attention prefill leaves single-thread-softmax class | fa-sanitize, fa-hd128-check, argmax |
| A3 | GDN chunked prefill kernels compile on 90a (hybrid.cu:420) | hybrid-arch prompts chunk-scan instead of tokenwise | run-hybrid logits vs llama.cpp |
| A4 | MMQ static lib on 90a (mmq_ffi.rs:194; keep 120a-only quants stubbed) | Q4_K/Q5_K/Q8_0 prefill via MMQ where profitable vs A1 | mmq gates + N=5 A/B vs A1 |
| A5 | cuBLASLt FP8 on 90a (fp8_ffi.rs:96) — H100 is the first-class FP8 arch | F8 checkpoints prefill via Lt (620-795 TF measured on 5090; H100 ceiling ~2× higher) | gemm-check vs cpu_linear, fp8 gates |
| A6 | smem/launch audit of un-gated kernels for 132 SM / 228 KB (occupancy re-tune only where ncu shows a wall) | free margins | ncu evidence per change |

Order A1→A2 first (Q8_0 bench model exercises both); A4/A5 after since they
need quant-specific or checkpoint-specific traffic. Every step lands with the
Rust predicate split: `portable_cuda` (89) vs `sm90a` (90a, portable + hopper
MMA subset on) so 89 stays honest.

**MEASURED (2026-07-26, commit 1b7cdad8, H100 box, N=5):** A1+A2+A3 landed as
one flip (`bw24_hopper_mma`). kernel-check ALL GREEN, 34 policy tests pass.
Prime 2048 tok: **5.15 s → 0.230 s (22×, ~8.9k tok/s prefill)** — TTFT target
(≤300 ms) met before any wgmma work. Decode 179.4 tok/s median — unchanged
(path untouched, as predicted). Prefill now ~25% of vLLM's 35k tok/s (was
1.1%). A4 (MMQ A/B) and A5 (FP8 Lt, needs an F8 checkpoint) remain open;
run-spec n/a on this checkpoint (no MTP head).

## 3. Phase B — the batched, lane-scheduled serving engine (the core build)

### B1. Paged KV pool (replaces single-sequence Cache)
- Block-paged KV: 32-token blocks, per-layer pools, quantized as today
  (K=q8_0, V=q5_1 — formats preserved so append/decode kernels change
  addressing, not math). Block table per sequence: `[seq][layer] -> Vec<block_id>`.
- `Cache` splits: `SeqState` (pos, block table, GDN/conv state, sampler state)
  vs `KvPool` (shared blocks + free list + per-lane accounting).
- Per-lane accounting on the pool IS the admission currency: lane quotas in
  blocks; harvest evictable (its contract tolerates requeue — shed-first lane).
- Recurrent layers (GDN/conv ring) are per-sequence dense state — they move to
  `SeqState` wholesale, `[B]`-indexed batched variants of the state kernels.
- Snapshot/rollback (spec) becomes block-table clone + refcount, not byte copy.

### B2. Batched step (replaces worker.rs round-robin)
One engine step = one fused pass over the active set:
1. gather per-seq tokens → `[B]` token ids (embed gather widened, decode.rs:83-94);
2. batched QKV/gate/FFN/lm_head: existing matmul m-tier with m=B rows —
   the weight stream amortizes across sequences (THE bandwidth win; the m=2-9
   fused-matvec tier and m≥16 GEMM tier already exist for spec verify);
3. attention per sequence over block tables: fa_decode gains a sequence axis
   (blockIdx.z or per-seq launch on the same stream — decide by ncu; split-K
   geometry per seq as today, combine unchanged);
4. batched KV append (`_rows` variant generalizes: per-row (seq, pos, block) triple);
5. batched sampler: extend `spec_sample.cu` Philox machinery to `[B]` rows
   device-side; argmax already has partial/final split — widen to row-major B.
   Kills the per-step full-vocab D2H (decode.rs:505) — return B sampled ids +
   B logprob scalars, not B×vocab floats.
6. Exactness ladder: B=1 batched path must produce bit-identical output to
   today's decode_step (extend `graph-decode-gate`); B>1 verified per-sequence
   vs isolated runs (worker.rs's own "byte-identical to isolated" contract).

### B3. Lane scheduler (yieldgate invariants, native)
Per-step admission planner replacing MAX_ACTIVE round-robin:
- Three queues (interactive / judge / harvest). Interactive always admitted to
  the step; judge admitted while measured interactive p99 < 100% SLO; harvest
  < 90%. Shed = immediate 429 at the server edge (never engine-queued) —
  identical thresholds to yieldgate.py:33 so the sidecar stays compatible.
- **Per-lane prefill budgets**: each step carries token budgets
  {interactive: unbounded-first, judge: J tok, harvest: H tok}; judge/harvest
  prefill chunks fill leftover step capacity only. This deletes the global-knob
  tax (the 11.6→40.6 ms baseline p99 cost of vLLM's single budget).
- True per-step timing: the engine records per-step decode latency per lane —
  replaces the sidecar's network-gap estimator with ground truth; exported at
  /yield/metrics-compatible endpoint.
- Preemption: harvest sequences preempt at block-pool pressure (evict via
  block-table park; resume = re-admit); judge chunks are naturally preemptible
  between chunks. Interactive never preempted.
- bw24-server keeps the axum surface + adds `x-lane` header intake (default
  interactive), SSE cadence unchanged (sidecar contract: `data:` chunks +
  `[DONE]`).

### B4. Serving integration
- Existing worker-thread model stays (one GPU thread, cmd channel); the
  scheduler owns the step loop; sessions become SeqState handles.
- Streaming path unchanged for clients; lane metrics endpoint added;
  graceful backpressure = shed responses at the edge.

**MEASURED (2026-07-26, commits 855162ae/f42fd94e/05f90270, H100 box):**
- decode_step_batch v1+v2: exactness battery ALL GREEN (strict bit-identity
  under equalized composition; config-mode argmax authority + bit-checked
  B=8 isolation). B=8 aggregate 306 tok/s (2.10×); remaining scaling gap =
  per-seq state-kernel launches → pooled state + blockIdx.z batching (B1 lane).
- Lane server LIVE: 14 concurrent sessions (4 interactive + 4 judge 2k-prompts
  + 6 harvest) — interactive p99 32.6 ms < 50 ms SLO at full mixed load,
  per-lane accounting exact, shed path 429, /yield/metrics engine-truth.
- **Serving-regime B-curve (ctx=512, N=3 medians, 2026-07-26):** B=1 148.8 /
  B=2 236.2 / B=4 367.8 / **B=8 487.2 tok/s aggregate (3.27×)** — the earlier
  306 figure was a short-prompt artifact (prompts under fa_vec_min_tkv profiled
  the f32 attention fallback at 21% of step time; nsys). BW24_BVAR sweep at
  m=8: auto≈base (490 vs 489) — the picker is fine; the residual efficiency
  gap (~30-35% of peak BW in mmvq_b8) lives inside the b8 kernel (ncu next).

**LANE BATTERY (2026-07-26, the B2-style demo record):** four scheduler defects
found by measurement and fixed (fixed-chunk stalls → per-tick stall bounds;
estimator starvation blind spot → sentinel; interactive cap serializing clients
→ cap follows batched capacity; decode-only estimator → full-tick TPOT +
SLO-headroom-adaptive dark chunks). Final NINT=12 battery: interactive p50 flat
41.5 ms at judge rates 0-8, p99 bounded 42-75 ms, zero starvation; dark lanes
duty-cycle honestly (judge 24 admitted/1348 shed at saturation). Envelope: 12
streams saturate the 50 ms SLO at today's decode ceiling — dark yield is real
at NINT≤8 (measured 15-18 ms TPOT + thousands of judge tok/s); widening it is
exactly the Phase C decode-wall work.

## 4. Phase C — the wgmma lane (the 3-4× decode headroom)

New kernels, guarded `bw24_hopper_mma`, tuned for 132 SM / 228 KB smem / HBM3:
- **C1 decode GEMM** (the prize): weight-streaming int8 wgmma
  (`wgmma.mma_async.m64nNk32.s8`) with TMA bulk loads + 3-4 stage smem
  pipeline, warp-specialized producer/consumer. Target 95-98% of the 352 tok/s
  wall single-seq (334-345 tok/s); at batch B the same kernel serves m=B rows.
  Validation: argmax MATCH vs dp4a path per shape; N=5 decode-bench A/B.
- **C2 prefill GEMM**: wgmma twin of qmatvec_gemm (int8) — chases whatever gap
  remains after Phase A (A1 may already sit near the roofline for m≤2k; ncu
  decides if C2 is worth it before building it).
- **C3 FA-3-class attention**: prefill mainloop on wgmma bf16 + TMA KV loads;
  decode split-K stays GEMV-shaped (bandwidth-bound; wgmma irrelevant there) —
  decode attention tuning is smem/cp.async/occupancy work, not MMA work.
- **C4 kernel-by-kernel sweep** (task 9): every kernel in cu/ gets an ncu pass
  on the box; keep/re-tune/replace verdict recorded in a table appended to this
  doc. Small kernels count (norm/rope/append/router): they set the non-GEMM
  floor that caps batched-step latency.

## 5. Phase D — shared extraction

What becomes shared crates (consumed by both the sm_120 laptop lane and this one):
- `bw24-kv`: block pool, block tables, quantized append/dequant views;
- `bw24-lanes`: lane types, admission policy, per-lane budgets, step planner
  (pure host logic — reusable over any backend, including the out-of-process sidecar
  as an out-of-process fallback);
- `bw24-sampling`: host sampler + device Philox sampling (already
  graph-safe) behind one trait;
- `bw24-cuda-util`: launch helpers, smem calculators, fatbin loading, ncu
  hooks (today duplicated across engine/probe);
- `bw24-validate`: kernel-check harness generalized (CPU references, tolerance
  policy, batched-path B=1..32 equivalence gates, N=5 protocol runner).
Extraction happens per-phase as pieces stabilize, never speculatively.

## 6. Validation protocol (all phases)

- Correctness: kernel-check ALL GREEN on box before any bench (repo law);
  argmax MATCH per engine change; spec gates (run-spec K=1..8) stay green on
  paths they cover; batched: B=1 bit-identity + per-seq equivalence at B∈{2,8,32}.
- Perf: N=5 medians, interleaved A/B where comparing engines; ncu evidence for
  every tuning claim; decode-bench + pp512 + TTFT tracked in a results table
  per phase.
- Lanes: interference.py --lanes against the served engine (judge/harvest rate
  sweeps); acceptance = B2/D1-class yields at ≤ their p99 cost, minus the
  global-knob baseline tax (the native scheduler's whole point).
- Fleet: H100 box per the private ops runbook; dead-man switch active; every session
  logs cost.

## 7. Task map

Tasks tracked in-session: 2=this doc, 3=B1, 4=B3, 5=B2, 6=A1-A6(+C2 if needed),
7=B4, 8=C1, 9=C4, 10=D, 11=validation harness, 12=end-to-end lane demo.
Sequencing: A first (cheap, unblocks everything), B1→B2→B3→B4 as the core
build, C1 parallel to B once A validates the toolchain, C4+D continuous.

**Q8_0 split-plane result (2026-07-26, commit fec8f234):** ALL GATES GREEN incl
strict bit-identity through the mirrors (249 tensors). Serving curve: B=2
236→266, B=4 368→420 (+14%), B=8 487→**526 tok/s (3.34×, 2.9× vLLM
single-seq)**. m=1 essentially flat (183.6) — the m=1 kernel's per-warp walk
was already sector-coalesced; its remaining gap to the 352 tok/s wall is
latency-bound (next: multi-block ILP / cp.async staging / mr2-style rows —
the continuing task-9 lane, with wgmma prefill as task 8).

**Tuning-lane ledger (2026-07-26, all N≥2 measured on the box):**
| probe | verdict |
|---|---|
| Q8_0 split-plane mirrors | **+14% B=4, +8% B=8, +2.8% m=1** — kept (fec8f234) |
| Q8_0 mr2 (q4_0 recipe) | −8% on H100 (132-SM grid math) — default mr1, kernel behind seam |
| MMVQ_ROWS 2/8 | kernel-check FAIL (cross-kernel invariant) — blocked by gates |
| KV_PREFETCH | +0.6% (noise) — not taken |
| batched-state pointer-array kernels | perf-neutral, launch hygiene kept — states pooled for future |
| prefill GEMM tiles (NSTAGE/BM/BN/K1_*) | ALL FLAT at 0.230s — GEMM is not the prime bound; profile says fa_prefill_f32_pp (415µs/call) + gdn_chunk pass are |
| MMQ vs qmatvec_gemm prefill | tie (0.231s both) |

Next frontier (evidence-ranked): (1) fa_prefill bf16 mainloop perf on H100
(415µs/call — wgmma/TMA candidate, task 8's real target, NOT the int8 GEMM);
(2) m=1 latency class (186→352 wall: cp.async staged weight ring);
(3) fa_decode_combine batching (64 launches/step at B=8);
(4) remaining shared extraction (bw24-validate, bw24-sampling, bw24-kv).

**m=1 ncu verdict (2026-07-26, qmatvec_q8_0_mmvq_rp on H100):** issue every
6-9 cycles, 0.16-0.29 eligible of ~7.5 active warps/scheduler (49% occupancy,
grid-limited on small out_f shapes) — long-scoreboard stall on the weight
stream. k-split (rpks) is BANNED (decode==verify FP-order law); the legal
lever is the rpca recipe (cp.async double-buffered weight ring, same
accumulation order = bit-identical): port q8_0_mmvq_rp -> _rpca next.
Expected class: NVFP4 rpca's long_scoreboard fix; target is the 250-300
tok/s band en route to the 334-345 wall goal (which likely also needs the
fused-launch family widened to rp).

**rpca probe (2026-07-26):** Q8_0 m=1 cp.async ring measured −2% (181.8 vs rp
185.5) — smem staging costs more than it hides for 8-bit direct-dp4a. Opt-in
seam kept. m=1 stands at 186 (~57% of achievable BW); the remaining gap is
per-shape latency work (grid fill on small out_f, register-window ILP) and
the non-matvec per-token floor — next probes need per-shape microbenches
(tools/bench_mapped_qmatvec.cu pattern), not whole-engine A/Bs.

**m=1 mystery RESOLVED (2026-07-26, per-shape microbench + graph A/B):**
tools/bench_q8_shapes.cu isolates the rp matvec per trunk shape: 97-100% of
peak on square shapes (4096x4096), 80-90% on wide (11-12k out, lm_head), 66%
on the sub-wave attn qkv, launch-floor on beta/alpha(32). Kernel times sum to
~297 tok/s — the kernels are essentially AT the wall. The 186 e2e gap is
~370 launches/token of gap overhead + per-token D2H sampling. PROOF: the
in-tree CUDA-graph decode (generate_graph) measures **214.1 tok/s (+14%)**
with zero new code. The m=1 road to 334-345: graph decode as the serving
default (graph-decode-gate covers bit-identity) + device-resident sampling
(argmax_token_device / spec_sample machinery exists) to kill the D2H — an
INTEGRATION lane now, not a kernel lane. Wide-shape 80% + attn-qkv 66% are
the only true kernel work left in the m=1 stack.

**g2 probe (2026-07-26):** sub-wave grid-fill twin kept (bit-identical, wins
in isolation on the 66%-peak qkv shape) but e2e-neutral at N=3 resolution —
the shape is 4 launches/token. Confirms the ledger rule: e2e A/Bs resolve
nothing below ~2%; per-shape microbench is the instrument. The one remaining
>5% m=1 lever is the GRAPH-SERVING integration (+14% measured standalone):
worker sessions on generate_graph + device sampling — an integration arc.

**Load-policy A/B (2026-07-26, per-shape tool):** __ldcs streaming beats plain
ldg by 13-37% on all weight-heavy shapes (+1.2% ldg only on lm_head) — load
policy exonerated. Wide-shape 80% decomposes as wave-quantization tail (5.8
waves at 3072 blocks ≈ 14%) + residual; next testable fix = persistent-CTA
row loop (grid = exact fill, per-row program unchanged = legal). ffn_down at
95.7%, squares at 97%, lm_head 90% — five of eight shapes effectively AT wall.

**Persistent-CTA probe (2026-07-26):** REFUTED — −11% wqkv, −12% ffn, −31%
ffn_down, −9% lm_head (stride-loop overhead + lost locality exceed the wave
tail). m=1 matvec per-shape survey COMPLETE: squares/down AT wall (96-100%),
lm_head 90%, wide 79-82% (best-known after ldg/persistent/rpca all refuted),
qkv 66% (g2 wins in isolation, e2e-invisible), beta/alpha launch-floor
(already dual-fused in the m=1 chain). The kernel family is surveyed; the
m=1 frontier is CONFIRMED as integration (graph serving + device sampler,
+14% measured floor) — kernel-side, only the FA-prefill mainloop remains.

**Graph-serving design pinned (2026-07-26):** generate_graph is whole-generation
(owns its Cache, primes internally — decode.rs:742) — routing lanes through it
whole-request blocks the scheduler tick ~1.2s/request = interactive p99
destroyed; DISQUALIFIED for concurrent serving. The +14% (and the device-
sampler D2H kill) therefore requires the step-wise refactor: a GraphSession
API — capture per (fa_vec, split) bucket ONCE against a session's resident
counters/cache, replay ONE step per scheduler tick, recapture on bucket cross.
The capture-region constraints are already solved in generate_graph's body
(event-tracking off, stable pointers, bucketed t_kv) — the refactor lifts that
loop body into a stepping struct. THIS is the single next arc for m=1-to-wall.

**GraphSession landed (2026-07-26, commit 7479e9ec):** step-wise CUDA-graph
decode — gate PASS (token stream == generate_graph exactly), **233.8 tok/s vs
179.3 eager (+30.4%)** = 66% of the 352 wall, from 53%, with zero kernel
changes. Confirms the integration thesis. Remaining m=1 ladder: worker wiring
(single-interactive-session policy), then multi-step replay between D2H syncs.

**Step decomposition (2026-07-26):** fa_apply 1µs + launch 25µs + gpu 4.25ms —
the graph step is 99% GPU-bound; multi-step replay KILLED pre-build (would
save 0.6%). Gap to wall = ~1.4ms/step of in-graph non-matvec GPU work (norm
rows ~0.5ms, attention+combine, state ops, argmax-248k, embed). Next
instruments: nsys graph-node timing; next levers: further norm-chain fusion,
combine batching, device argmax split tuning. Session A/B improved to +34%
(234.0 vs 174.5 eager on the 48-tok-prompt shape).

**Graph-serving LIVE (2026-07-26, commits b90cae99..190ba549):** single-session
lane serving real HTTP at **217 tok/s for long generations** (512 tok; +20% vs
eager serving, 62% of wall end-to-end incl. HTTP+prime). Promotion gated at
BW24_GS_MIN=384 tokens (capture+snapshot ~340ms one-time = ~330-tok
break-even); degrade-to-batched live-validated with 3 concurrent clients
(correct output through the cache handoff). Serve-mode flags OnceLock'd,
metrics publish throttled. Remaining serving polish: ~0.2s fixed per-request
setup on the short path; capture-cost reduction would move break-even down.

**Task-8 opening measurement (2026-07-26, OPEN):** two nsys attempts at a
single-2048 prime profile captured run-gen on the TOKENWISE prime path
(245k m=1 matvecs = 2048 stepwise) — run-gen's batched-prime branch engages
under conditions not yet located (bench_bw24's own timer reports 0.230s
batched prime for the same invocation shape). Before the wgmma FA build:
find the branch, profile the true batched prime, size FA's share. The
wgmma payoff bound is unknown until then — do not build blind.

**Task-8 scope CORRECTED by clean profile (2026-07-26, BW24_PP_ONLY):** pure
batched-prime kernel shares: **MMQ int8 GEMM 60.1%** (688µs/launch), split-
plane build 9.5% (load-time artifact), **fa_prefill_f32_pp 9.3%** (2.65ms/call
× 8 full-attn layers), gdn_chunk 6%+. The earlier "FA mainloop dominates"
read came from a contaminated mixed capture — task 8's wgmma target is the
PREFILL GEMM (m≥16 int8 class, both MMQ and qmatvec_gemm tie today), worth
up to ~2.4× on prime if wgmma reaches its int8 ceiling; FA prefill is the
secondary 9% target. Measurement discipline saved building the wrong kernel
a second time.

**wgmma arc OPENED (2026-07-26):** tools/bench_q8_gemm_wgmma.cu — standalone
dev harness (synthetic Q8_0, CPU reference, timing) + v0 kernel
(m64n64k32.s8 warpgroup mainloop, per-block scale fold). ptxas ACCEPTS wgmma
on the 90a build (the build.rs "separate later lane" is open). v0 status:
illegal memory access on first launch — smem descriptor encoding (LBO/SBO,
canonical no-swizzle layout) is the live bug; fragment row/col mapping
unverified until it runs. Iteration cycle: 30s standalone compile+run.
Target: beat the 688µs int8-mma class = up to 2.4× on prime.
Debug hint for the v0 fault: plain row-major smem does NOT match wgmma's
canonical no-swizzle operand layout — the tile must be arranged in CORE-MATRIX
order (8-row × 16B cores; A 64×32 = 8 M-cores × 2 K-cores; store core(m,k)
at ((m*2+k)*8 + r)*16, then LBO/SBO encode inter-core strides: try LBO=128,
SBO=256 first, then the transposed pairing). Verify against PTX ISA §9.7.14
asynchronous-warpgroup-level matrix shape/layout tables before trusting signs.
v0 UPDATE (same day): core-matrix smem order + LBO=128/SBO=256 → kernel RUNS:
**169µs = 4.1× the MMQ class raw** (101.6 int8 TOP/s, unpipelined, correctness
still FAIL rel~1e2 — the s32 D-fragment row/col mapping needs the exact PTX
ISA table; speed already proves the arc: 60%-of-prime × 4 ≈ prime 0.23→0.13s
before pipelining). Next mechanical step: fix fragment mapping (PTX ISA
wgmma.mma_async D layout, m64nN), verify vs CPU ref, then cp.async pipeline.
Layout search verdict (160+ combos, best rel 12.6, none pass): the descriptor
stride space cannot express the fix — B arrives token-major but wgmma consumes
K-major B; the smem WRITE arrangement for B must perform the transpose into
the canonical K-major core order (and/or SW128 swizzle), not the descriptor.
Next: derive from PTX ISA §wgmma matrix-layout tables + a known-good open
int8 wgmma kernel, write the ONE correct arrangement, verify vs CPU ref.
The 4.1× raw-speed result stands — only operand plumbing remains.
v0 status (end of stretch): B transpose-in-write confirmed directionally
(error class changed; gather costs 169→411µs, still under MMQ 688 — v1 will
quantize activations directly into K-major, killing the gather). Exact core
arrangement still wrong after ~170 tested combos — STOP guessing: the fix
requires the PTX ISA wgmma matrix-layout table (§9.7.15) or cross-reading a
known-good open int8 wgmma kernel (marlin-hopper / FA3 source). Both are
fetchable references; one derivation, one verify run. Everything else in the
arc (harness, CPU ref, fragment mapping, 4.1× speed proof) is in place.
**v0 CORRECT (2026-07-26, the arc's breakthrough):** rel err 1.6e-05 OK at
**179µs = 3.84× the MMQ class**, unpipelined. Root causes (via Colfax/PTX
canonical reference): (1) the missing `fence.proxy.async.shared::cta` between
generic-proxy smem writes and async-proxy wgmma reads — THE correctness bug
all along; (2) original core-matrix arrangements were canonical (A and B both
core(i,j) = i*SBO(256) + j*LBO(128) + row*16, K-major no-swizzle) — the
"transpose fix" detour was wrong. Path to integration: k-slice pipeline
(cp.async or TMA), Q8_0 dequant-fold epilogue check vs qmatvec_gemm bit
policy, engine dispatch at m>=16, kernel-check case, prime A/B (expect
0.23s -> ~0.10-0.13s = prefill toward 60-80% of vLLM).

**wgmma engine integration + the honest verdict (2026-07-26, task 8 closed
for the exact path):** the "3.84×" was a BASELINE ERROR — the harness's
"688µs MMQ ref" was a pp2048-shape figure; the real per-launch MMQ medians at
m=512 (nsys per-shape, grid-dim split + duration clustering) are: wqkv
4096→12288 253µs, mid→8192 168µs, square 4096² **84-99µs**, ffn_down
11008→4096 ~247µs, gate/up 4096→11008 236µs, small→1024 82µs.

Kernel ladder (all CORRECT, rel ≤5e-5 vs CPU ref; engine gate rel ~3e-7 vs
MMQ on real GGUF tensors, kernel-check ALL GREEN):
- v0 unpipelined 64×64: 516µs wqkv — e2e pp512 3845 vs MMQ 8692 tok/s (2.26× LOSS).
- v1 64×128 single-acc: 246 regs → occupancy collapse, worse than v0.
- v2a dual-acc via acc[2][32] runtime index → LOCAL MEMORY (256B stack): 1116µs. Fixed
  by pair-unrolling (acc0/acc1 static): 157 regs, 459µs.
- v3 = v2 + TRANSPOSED activation scales ([blk][tok], coalesced 16B cp.async): 414µs.
  Untransposed engine layout costs ~15% (measured) — any engine port stages a
  transposed twin.
- v4 = 2-warpgroup ping-pong, shared A tile, N=128/CTA, __launch_bounds__(256,2):
  wqkv 344µs, square 116µs, small 72µs. NSTAGE/LA sweep flat (4/2 fine).
- CEILING PROBE (fold law lifted, scale_d=1 full-K s32): wqkv 313µs vs 120µs W-traffic
  floor — even fold-free, the n64-class pipeline only reaches MMQ's level.

ROOT CAUSE (architectural, not tuning): Q8_0's per-32-block scale fold reads
wgmma accumulator registers every 32-K step; ptxas C7514 "wgmma serialized due
to non-wgmma instructions reading accumulator registers" — the dual-acc
overlap is compiled out, the warpgroup tensor pipe drains every block. The
Ampere-style mma.m16n8k32 path (vendored MMQ) tolerates per-block folds via
warp-level ILP; DeepGEMM-class fp8 kernels live with per-128 folds (4× fewer)
plus SASS-level interleaving. Per-32 exact int8 block-scale GEMM on Hopper
belongs to mma, not wgmma.

VERDICT: v4 wins ONLY out_f=1024 (72 vs 82µs, ~0.8% of prime). BW24_WGMMA=1
opt-in seam kept; MMQ stays default (N=5 pp512: MMQ 8692 vs wgmma-v0 3845 —
law holds). Correctness stays pinned: kernel-check wgmma case is cfg-gated.
NEXT SWING (prefill is still 60% MMQ at 178µs avg): non-exact numeric-config
probe — fp16-dequant GEMM (resident fp16 mirror + cuBLASLt, or in-kernel
dequant + fp16 wgmma full-K f32-accum, which streams with ZERO mid-loop acc
reads). Precedent: BW24_PP_FP8 (620-795TF) / BW24_FP4 opt-in seams; gate =
argmax battery + logit tolerance, not bit-identity.

**FP16-mirror prefill — the fold-free swing (2026-07-26, PROMOTED default on
the Hopper lane):** the wgmma verdict pointed the way: the per-32 fold law is
the wall, so lift the operand format instead of fighting the pipe. Probe
(tools/bench_lt_f16.cu): cuBLASLt FP16 TN runs 611-687 TF at the m=512 model
shapes = 3.2-3.7x the MMQ class per launch. Engine arm (BW24_PP_F16,
fp8_prefill.cu pattern): resident fp16 dequant mirror of every 2D Q8_0
projection built device-side at load (f16_ffi::build_q8_f16, budget
BW24_PP_F16_BUDGET_MB default 32GB, layer-order prefix), dispatch in
matmul/matmul_pre m>=16 arms AFTER fp8, BEFORE MMQ. Decode (m<16) untouched —
decode==verify law holds by construction.

Numeric config (explicit, gated): int8 part exact in fp16 (7 mantissa bits
into 11); rounding at d*q products + activation f32->fp16 cast (NO per-32
rescale on the act side). Battery: kernel-check f16 case rel <= 6.5e-3
(band 1e-2) ALL GREEN; run-gen argmax MATCH p1/p2/p3; greedy streams
IDENTICAL to MMQ config on all three; serving smoke (600-tok prompt) coherent.

MEASURED (N=5 medians, 9B-Q8_0):
- pp512:  8674 -> 15626 tok/s (+80%)
- pp2048: 8260 -> 14543 tok/s (+76%)  [the old "0.230s prime" -> 0.141s]
- VRAM: 18.1 -> 31.8GB served (mirror ~2B/w on 2D Q8_0 trunk) — 80GB lane feature
- validate-h100.sh ALL GATES GREEN; batch curve unchanged (decode path untouched)

Default ON under bw24_hopper_mma (BW24_PP_F16=0 reverts to MMQ; =1 forces on
smaller rigs at their own VRAM risk). MMQ stays the exact-config fallback and
the portable default. Next prefill ceiling: FA prefill 9.3% + GDN chunk
kernels now dominate prime — new profile needed for the next target.

**matmul_group / convert-once (2026-07-26, kept, perf-NEUTRAL):** grouped the
7 shared-activation call-site families (GDN 4-tuple, attn q/k/v, ffn gate/up)
through `matmul_group` — the f16 arm converts the activation once per group
(saves ~160 cvt launches/prime). Measured pp512 15626 -> 15391 -> 15545 across
runs = one noise band; the gap clusters were NOT cvt-bound (they sit at layer
boundaries before rms_norm — host submission cadence, not launch count).
Kept: no regression, and one-xh-per-group is the shape a future prefill graph
capture wants. Honest-neutral, recorded per the launch-collapse precedent.

Prime anatomy at 15.5k tok/s (per-prime, nsys): fp16 GEMMs ~10ms @660TF
(near HW for Lt-heuristic), GDN chunk family ~5.9ms, elementwise+norms ~5.4ms,
FA prefill f32 ~3.2ms, launch gaps ~7.5ms over ~1030 launches. vLLM prefill
ref 35k tok/s (w8a8 int8 GEMMs ~1300TF class + fused epilogues). Next arcs
ranked: (1) GDN chunk kernels to their wall (18%), (2) FA prefill tensor-core
port (10%, FA3-class arc), (3) norm/add fusion + prefill graph capture for the
gap structure (22%), (4) cutlass int8 per-row epilogue GEMM (the vLLM numeric
config) if (1)-(3) exhaust.

**Prime grind round 2 (2026-07-26, after the f16 promotion):** pp512
15626 -> 16679-16839 tok/s across three landed changes + two refuted probes:
- zeros->uninit on 47 full-overwrite prefill buffers (+4.5%): nsys cuda_api_sum
  showed 1230 memsets/trace + cuMemAllocAsync pool-miss tails (med 980ns,
  avg 22us) as the layer-boundary gap fuel. state_in/out keep semantic zeros.
- elementwise float4 wave: silu_mul + add + f16 cvt (+2.7%): bit-identical per
  element; decode/graph token-exact gates green. Norm reductions untouched
  (sum order pinned by decode==verify).
- matmul_group convert-once: neutral, kept (launch structure).
- REFUTED: Lt algo autotune (neutral + cold-start cost, reverted); GDN chunk
  C sweep re-validated shipped default C=32 on the new profile (C=128 tanks 32%).
Launch gaps 22% -> 12-18%; launches 1028 -> 910/prime.

REMAINING ARCS (each multi-day, evidence attached in this ledger):
1. GDN K4 (gdn_chunk_state) runs ~9TF f32, smem+serial-bound over NC chunks —
   a bf16-mma rewrite of its C x D GEMM steps is the chunked-config upgrade path.
2. FA prefill is ALREADY the bf16-mma FA-2 floor port (P0a/P0b/C4 arcs) at
   ~400-540us/launch — next step is an ncu-driven stall analysis, not a rewrite.
3. Prefill CUDA-graph capture (gap floor ~12% remains).
4. cutlass int8 per-row-epilogue GEMM (vLLM's numeric config) if 1-3 exhaust.
Standing vs vLLM: decode 101%, prefill ~48% (16.8k vs 35k) — was 1.1% at boot.

**FA prefill ncu diagnosis (2026-07-26, arc #2 sharpened):** fa_prefill_f32_pp
at T=512: SM throughput 3.6%, memory 9.2% — pure latency exposure. ncu full:
255 regs/thread (the P0a/P0b Q-in-reg + O-in-reg design) -> Block Limit
Registers = 2, theoretical occupancy 12.5%, ACHIEVED 6.25% (grid 128 CTAs on
132 SMs, <1 wave, 4 warps/SM effectively); 67% of stall cycles = long
scoreboard on the synchronous f32->bf16 K/V stage-to-smem. mma m16 pins 16
query rows/warp, so occupancy can't come from smaller tiles — the fix is
HIDING the latency: software-pipeline / double-buffer the K/V staging (same
tiles, same math order -> bit-identical, no new numeric config). GDN K4 by
contrast measures 59.6% memory SOL at 130us — much closer to its config's
wall; its upgrade stays the bf16-mma rewrite (numeric-config class).
FA pipeline arc projected: 625us -> plausibly 150-250us/launch = +8-10% pp512.

**Phase D extraction CLOSED (2026-07-26):** the shared-crate scoreboard —
- bw24-lanes ✓ (lane types, admission, budgets — serving consumes it)
- bw24-sampling ✓ (host sampler + device Philox behind one trait)
- bw24-validate ✓ (protocol core: maxdiff/rel banding, deterministic pr vectors,
  N-median runner, GateTally ALL-GREEN contract; 4 gate bins ported verbatim;
  fa_sanitize's 16-bit pr variant deliberately stays local — different vectors)
- bw24-kv ✓ (dual cache + KV format policy behind the KvDev seam. The documented
  "Engine-trait blocker" dissolved on measurement: the cache uses exactly 7
  device ops — zeros/uninit/alloc_u8/htod_i32/clone_dtod/copy_into/set_i32_one —
  so the seam is that trait, not an engine-wide abstraction. Engine impl
  delegates to inherent methods; every call site unchanged via re-export.)
- bw24-cuda-util ✗ REFUTED as speculative: bw24-probe's "duplication" is 64
  lines of raw cudarc idiom appropriate to a probe; no shared body exists.
  Extraction law ("never speculatively") applies.
All gates green on box after each move (validate-h100 + graph-session token-exact).

**FA prefill W2 probe (2026-07-26, REFUTED at T=512):** the 2-warp/32-row CTA
variant (grid.x x2, bit-identical per-row math) measured pp512 15452 vs 16677
default — the doubled K/V staging traffic + halved per-CTA warps cost more
than the coverage gain. THIRD refuted FA hypothesis (after MINBLOCKS 3/4):
this kernel is at a real local optimum; the remaining path is the FA3-class
producer/consumer redesign (TMA staging + warp specialization). Seam kept
(BW24_FA_PP_W2=1): at dark-lane chunk sizes (T=256 -> grid 64 CTAs, half the
SMs idle) W2's coverage argument doubles — an untested SERVING-side hypothesis
the lane battery should arbitrate, not pp512.

**W8A8 per-row arc REFUTED BY PROBE (2026-07-26, tools/bench_lt_i8.cu):** the
"vLLM numeric config" (int8 W per-row x int8 act per-token, s32 GEMM + f32
dequant epilogue) measures NET 0.87-1.04x vs the SHIPPED fp16 mirror at every
m=512 shape: int8 IMMA only reaches 654-892 TOP/s here (not the 2x-of-fp16
datasheet ratio), and the epilogue pass (5-19us) eats the remainder. VERDICT:
the fp16-mirror path is at the practical H100 GEMM ceiling for this workload —
no dtype change buys more; a fused-epilogue cutlass kernel would at best
reclaim the 5-19us epilogue, which the probe shows is not worth the arc.
STRATEGIC COROLLARY: vLLM's remaining prefill edge (35k vs 16.7k) is
STRUCTURAL, not GEMM-rate — fused epilogues/norms into GEMMs, TC attention,
fewer launches, graphs. The remaining roadmap is exactly the three structural
arcs: FA3 staging redesign, GDN K4 bf16-mma, prefill graph capture.

**GDN K4 bf16-mma arc — KERNEL PROVEN (2026-07-26, tools/bench_gdn_k4.cu):**
v2 measures **68.3us vs the shipped f32 K4's 119.4us (1.75x)** at the real
dims (H=32, T=512, C=32, D=128 — harness calibrated: v0 port reproduces the
engine's ~130us). Design: M state lives in mma accumulator FRAGMENTS across
all chunks (16 f32/thread; bC fold = register scale); step A (Y = U - W.M)
and step B (M += ys^T.k) are m16n8k16 bf16 warp-tiled GEMMs (FA's proven
ldmatrix helpers); W and k arrive PRE-CONVERTED bf16 (engine: K3 casts W on
store for free; k gets one mirror pass) through a 2-deep cp.async ring —
the probe showed synchronous global->bf16 staging was 72us of v1's 133.
Numerics: operands round to bf16 per chunk, state carry stays f32 —
rel 1.3e-2 vs CPU ref on hostile (exploding) synthetic data; a change WITHIN
the gated chunked prefill config (BW24_GDN_CHUNKED), arbitrated by the
BW24_GDN_DIFF oracle + argmax battery on adoption.
Debug ledger: (1) B operands must be [n][k] in smem — Mb mirror goes NATURAL
[col][i] (no transpose!), kb needs ld_A_trans (both are FA GEMM0/PV patterns);
(2) remaining known slack: Ssnap fragment-scatter ~15us (stage via smem later).
Engine integration next: K3 bf16-W store, k bf16 mirror, BW24_GDN_MMA seam,
oracle + battery. Projected prime: K4 2.8 -> ~1.6ms (+4% pp512).

**GDN K4-MMA engine integration (2026-07-26): landed OPT-IN, promotion gated
on a state-carry battery.** Engine kernel gdn_chunk_state_mma (hybrid.cu,
k4mma helpers) + f32_to_bf16_bulk mirrors + BW24_GDN_MMA seam (C==32 only).
Battery: pp512 16694 -> 17286 (+3.5%), argmax MATCH x3, greedy streams
identical, oracle out mean_rel ~1e-4. HOWEVER the kernel-check f64-truth
STATE pin (2.5e-4) reads 4.25e-1 under mma on hostile synthetics — bf16
rounding accumulates in the recurrent state, which feeds decode and session
continuation; 16-token battery windows cannot rule out long-generation drift.
DEFAULT STAYS f32-chunked (its tight pin untouched); the mma config got its
OWN kernel-check pin (out<8e-2, state<8e-1 — regression guard, measured
4.30e-2/4.25e-1). PROMOTION CRITERION: long-context chunked prime -> long
decode + multi-turn continuation battery showing no stream drift vs f32.
Ragged-T edge verified clean in harness (T=200/488 in band).

**GDN K4-MMA PROMOTED (2026-07-26, state-carry battery green):** promotion
criterion met — 2048-token prime (64 in-kernel state carries) -> 256 greedy
decode tokens IDENTICAL to f32 on 3 seeds; chunked-continuation prime
(BW24_PRIME_CHUNK=512, 4 cross-call carries through cache.recur) IDENTICAL on
2 seeds. Default ON on the Hopper lane; kernel-check pins BOTH configs by
forcing the seam env per case (f32 tight band + mma 8e-2/8e-1 band).
pp512 DEFAULT: 16694 -> 17240 tok/s. Night cumulative: 8674 -> 17240 (+99%).
Remaining task-9 arcs: FA3 staging redesign, prefill graph capture.

**GDN K5-MMA + coupled pair (2026-07-26): LANDED default, pp512 17786.** K5
(gdn_chunk_output) followed the K4 playbook: harness v1 (mma, f32 sources) was
correct but NEUTRAL (62->62us — K5 is staging-bound like K4 was); v2 with
bf16 sources + cp.async double-buffer hit 35.3us (1.78x). Engine adoption
coupled the pair: K4-mma writes Y/Ssnap directly in half precision (their only
consumer is K5-mma, which rounds anyway — no extra numeric hop, half the
traffic). FIRST coupling attempt in bf16 FAILED its own config pin (out
2.19e-1 vs 8e-2 band: K4 error compounding through K5's bf16 rounding) —
switched the coupled channel + K5 operands to FP16 (11 mantissa bits): pin
back to 4.28e-2 in band, pp 17786. mma m16n8k16.f16 = same rate as bf16;
ld_A/ldmatrix are type-agnostic b16 moves.
decode-batch-gate note: the config-mode gate1 (decode_step_batch vs
decode_step_h, step-16 threshold) flipped at step 1 under the mma prime —
STRICT bit-gate + gate2 still PASS, so decode is untouched; the mma-primed
state shifted near-tie logits on the gate's fixed prompt. Fixed by PINNING the
gate's prime config to f32 (the gate tests DECODE configs; prime is a nuisance
variable there — doc'd in the bin).
Battery (coupled pair default): validate-h100 ALL GREEN, graph-session
token-exact, state-carry IDENTICAL x2 seeds, 3-prompt streams IDENTICAL to
f32, argmax MATCH. Night cumulative: pp512 8674 -> 17786 (+105%).

**FA BF16-KV staging (2026-07-26): +11% pp512, BIT-IDENTICAL, default ON.**
The FA3-lite the ncu evidence was pointing at all along: the kernel already
rounds K/V to bf16 during staging (64 scalar f32 loads + converts per thread —
the 67%-of-stalls long-scoreboard). Pre-converting K/V to bf16 mirrors
(f32_to_bf16_bulk, 2 launches per fa_prefill call) feeds the SAME
__float2bfloat16 values into the SAME mma -> outputs bit-identical (verified:
argmax + logit maxdiff lines byte-equal across arms); staging becomes 8 int4
vector copies per thread. fa_prefill_bf16kv_pp twins (body templated on
BF16KV); BW24_FA_BF16KV=0 reverts. pp512 17777 -> 19718 (+11%).
NIGHT CUMULATIVE: 8674 -> 19718 (+127%); prefill now ~56% of vLLM's 35k.
The three refuted FA occupancy probes stand; the remaining FA headroom is the
full FA3 producer/consumer redesign (cp.async ring on the now-bf16 tiles is
the next increment — the mirrors make it a plain byte ring, no convert).
Remaining arcs: FA cp.async ring, prefill graph capture, K2/K3/conv GDN passes.

**FA cp.async ring on bf16 tiles (2026-07-26): +0.85% (pp512 19886),
bit-identical.** The 2-stage ring prefetches tile k0+BK behind the current
tile's mma (only copy TIMING changes — bit-check byte-equal). The vectorized
bf16 staging had already absorbed most of the stall; the ring takes the rest.
FA slice now effectively at its non-redesign wall. pp512 night cumulative:
8674 -> 19886 (+129%); prefill ~57% of vLLM. Remaining structural arcs:
prefill graph capture (gap floor), full FA3 warp specialization (diminishing
vs the above), remaining GDN small kernels (conv/cumgate/solve/attn).

**Round-9 wall audit (2026-07-26, anatomy at 19.9k):** per-prime: GEMMs 10.3ms
(practical ceiling — W8A8 + autotune refuted), GDN state-mma 1.56 + output-mma
0.85 (post-mma walls), FA 1.07 (was 4.3 — bf16kv+ring), conv 0.95, norms+cvt
~3.2, gaps 3.7ms (15%). Probes this round:
- ssm_conv1d_gdn float4: NEUTRAL, reverted — the kernel's wall is the GQA
  broadcast WRITE amplification (~25MB materialized q/k copies), not tap loads.
  Mapped option for later: de-broadcast layout (k/q stay [T, num_k, 128];
  consumers map vh -> vh % num_k) — touches K2/K4/K5 mirrors, prefill-only.
- Norm reductions (l2/rms, ~1.7ms) stay pinned: any load-width change reorders
  the reduction tree and the SAME kernels serve decode (decode==verify law).
THE remaining structural arc is prefill graph capture (3.7ms gap floor);
everything else measured at or near its wall for this design generation.

**TASK-9 KERNEL SWEEP CLOSED (2026-07-26):** every prime-path kernel measured
at or near its wall, each with landed wins or refutation evidence: GEMMs (fp16
mirror @660TF; W8A8 + Lt-autotune refuted by probe), FA (bf16kv + ring, 4x;
three occupancy probes refuted; FA3 full rewrite = diminishing), GDN K4/K5
(mma coupled pair, 1.75x/1.78x, fp16 channel), conv (scatter-wall, float4
refuted, de-broadcast mapped), norms (decode-law-pinned), elementwise (float4
wave landed), launch diet (uninit conversion). Serving-lane measurement closed
the attribution: scheduler+HTTP cost 7%; the remaining 2x to vLLM serving
prefill is cross-request prefill CONCATENATION (their continuous batching runs
bigger GEMM m) — scheduler work, not kernels. OPEN ARCS (tracked as tasks):
cross-request prefill batching (decode_step_batch pattern applied to prime)
and prefill graph capture (15% gap floor). Night: pp512 8674 -> 19886 (+129%),
bench-shape prefill 398 -> 18659 (47x), TTFT 5.15s -> 0.119s, decode 102% vLLM.

## Task #13 design — cross-request prefill batching (the measured 2x)

WHY (measured 2026-07-26): serving prefill 17.3k vs vLLM 35k; scheduler costs
only 7% — the whole remaining gap is GEMM batch size (vLLM concatenates
prefill chunks across requests; our tick primes one request at a time; nvjet
at m=512 runs ~660TF and larger m climbs toward the fp16 ceiling).

DESIGN (decode_step_batch precedent, applied to prime):
- New `prime_cache_batch(e, prompts: &[&[u32]], caches: &mut [&mut Cache])` in
  hybrid_forward. Embed CONCATENATED tokens [sum_T, n_embd]; per layer:
  * BATCHED on the concat buffer (one launch, m = sum_T): rms_norm chains,
    qkv/out/gate-up/down projections (matmul_group / f16 GEMMs), elementwise,
    ffn. These are token-parallel — rows independent.
  * PER-SEQ on contiguous VIEWS of the concat buffer (offsets = prefix sums,
    zero copies): rope (positions restart per seq), QK-norm is token-parallel
    (safe either way), FA prefill, conv+GDN chunk stack (chunk kernels take
    per-seq T), KV quantize-append, per-seq last-token logits.
- Worker tick: collect up to BW24_PRIME_BATCH (default 4) pending interactive
  FRESH prefills (continuation primes stay single — the suffix arm is
  session-stateful); dispatch prime_cache_batch; per-seq TTFT emitted as each
  seq's logits land.
- NUMERIC CONFIG: batched GEMM at m=sum_T tiles K differently than per-seq m
  -> NOT bit-identical to single primes (same class as every prefill GEMM
  change). Gate: batch-vs-sequential ARGMAX equality per seq on the prompt
  battery + logit-band + the standard batteries. Decode untouched (per-seq
  caches identical structure after prime).
- GATE BIN: prime_batch_gate — N prompts, prime individually vs batched,
  compare per-seq prefill argmax + decode-16 streams + state maxdiff bands.
- EXPECTED: GEMM m 512->2048 lifts the 10.3ms GEMM slice toward the ceiling
  (+15-25% aggregate prefill), amortizes the per-tick fixed costs; stacks
  with task #14 (graphs) toward the 35k lane target.

**Task #13 increment 2 (2026-07-26): prime_cache_batch LANDED + regime mapped.**
Driver: trunk (embed/norms/adds/ffn/projection groups) on CONCAT tokens
(m = sum_T); stateful mixer cores per seq on split projection buffers (D2D).
prime-batch-gate ALL GREEN (uneven lengths: per-seq prefill argmax MATCH +
16-step decode streams MATCH vs individual primes). MEASURED REGIME (N=5):
  B=8 T=64:  5034 -> 9073 tok/s  (+80.2%)
  B=8 T=128: 8741 -> 13009 tok/s (+48.8%)
  B=4 T=128: 8859 -> 12783 tok/s (+44.3%)
  B=4 T=512: 17980 -> 16326 tok/s (-9.2%)  <- per-seq m already at plateau;
    split/gather copies eat the margin. Crossover ~T=256-384.
POLICY: batch prefills when per-seq T <= BW24_PRIME_BATCH_MAX_T (default 320),
else single-prime — exactly the serving mix (chat prompts are mostly short;
the aggregate serving prefill number was measured on 937-token prompts, i.e.
the UNFAVORABLE side; the favorable side was previously WORSE than measured).
Next: worker tick integration + serving re-measurement.

**Task #13 increment 3 (2026-07-26): worker batch-prime LANDED, +21.6% serving
throughput at the short-prompt load.** Tick phase (b) collects fresh short
interactive prefills (T in [PRIME_MIN_T, BW24_PRIME_BATCH_MAX_T=320], same
model, budget-fitting) and dispatches prime_cache_batch in ROUNDS of up to
BW24_PRIME_BATCH=4; a lone fresh candidate holds up to
BW24_PRIME_BATCH_HOLD_MS=4 so staggered arrivals coalesce (TTFT cost <= 4ms).
Debug ledger (telemetry-driven): v1 fired on only 25% of a 32-concurrent burst
(arrivals staggered across ~1ms ticks) -> the hold; then a tick with 8 pending
batched 4 and SINGLE-primed the rest -> rounds. Final: 98% of burst tokens
batched (14288/14592). Serving A/B (96 x 152-tok, conc 32, max_tokens=1):
off 7971 -> on 9689 tok/s (+21.6%). Long prompts (937t > MAX_T) byte-unchanged
(17188 vs 17189). prime-batch-gate + validate-h100 ALL GREEN.

**Task #14 verdict (2026-07-26): the gap floor is NOT launch-count-bound —
graphs or acceptance.** Norm+cvt fusion landed (rms_norm_f16out emits the
GEMM's fp16 operand in the norm epilogue — BIT-IDENTICAL, byte-checked vs the
pre-fusion build; kills ~64 convert launches/prime + their re-read traffic)
and measured NEUTRAL (19,872 = the 19.9k band), exactly like matmul_group's
convert-once before it. TWO independent launch-diet passes now show the 3.7ms
gap floor does not shrink with launch count at this granularity — the residual
is per-launch host cost x remaining ~700 launches plus legitimate inter-op
drains. Reclaiming it means TRUE prime graph capture (single cuGraphLaunch;
the pointer-table generalization) — the one remaining structural arc — or
accepting the floor. Fusion KEPT (bit-identical, less traffic, groundwork:
the fp16-operand plumbing is what a graphed prime wants anyway).
All gates green (validate, graph-session, prime-batch); serving short-burst
9334 tok/s (9689 band).

## Task #14 design v2 — prime graph capture IS tractable (pad-to-bucket analysis)

The 50-kernel device-length estimate was WRONG. With prompts PADDED to a
bucket (graph shape fully static), the causal structure absorbs the pads:
- FA prefill: real query i attends keys <= i — all REAL rows. Pad-query
  outputs are garbage and DISCARDED. No kernel change.
- GEMMs/norms/elementwise: token-parallel; pad rows compute garbage, harmless.
- GDN recurrence is the crux — pads would UPDATE state. But the update law is
  state' = exp(g)*state + beta*(...): forcing beta[pad]=0 AND g_log[pad]=0
  makes pads IDENTITY steps. ONE tiny mask kernel (reads true_len from a
  device int) after the beta/g_log producers.
Device-length spots (the ONLY dynamic scalars): (1) that beta/g mask,
(2) conv ring writeback must take rows [true_len-pad, true_len) not the pad
tail — device-int variant of the ring update, (3) KV len_d finalize = host
memcpy after replay (rows beyond true_len sit inert past len), (4) last-token
logits row = device-index gather before lm_head.
Session pointers: the fresh-prime graph touches the cache ONLY via KV append
(K, V, len_d), conv ring, ssm_state/alt — ~5 ptrs x 32 layers = one ~1.3KB
device pointer TABLE, memcpy'd per replay (kernels index the table; the
decode pointer-table precedent is decode_step_batch's u64 tables).
Capture: once per (bucket, model) at server start (~340ms x buckets
{128,256,384,512} ~ 1.4s startup); replay = memcpy table+tokens+len, ONE
cuGraphLaunch. Waste <= 25% on bucket padding (policy: nearest bucket >= T;
below 128 the batch-prime path already dominates).
Gate: graphed prime vs eager prime — per-seq argmax + decode-stream + state
maxdiff battery (prime-batch-gate pattern). Prize: the 3.7ms/prime gap floor
(~15%) + host freed for scheduling.

**Task #14 implementation state (2026-07-26, next increment = capture smoke):**
`Engine::capture_graph_retained` (the decode-graph machinery) takes the prime
closure as-is ONCE a capture-safe prime variant exists. Constraints audited:
- prime_chunk's `e.htod_i32(&pos)` must HOIST out (H2D inside capture bakes a
  node reading a dropped host Vec — replay UAF); pos_d becomes a param.
- the tail `e.dtoh(&logits)` must go device-resident (return CudaSlice; the
  worker reads it post-replay) — same for h_seed/hidden.
- `cache.pos += t` is HOST state — advance outside the closure.
- KV append position: the batched append takes pos as a HOST int — baked 0 is
  CORRECT for fresh-prime graphs (the only graphed class; continuation stays
  eager).
- warmup pool stability + capture_keep retention already handled by
  capture_graph_retained (draft-graph precedent).
INCREMENT ORDER: (1) prime_chunk_captured (capture-safe copy, ~70 lines) +
smoke bin proving the ~900-launch prime captures + replays byte-equal on a
fixed cache (riskiest unknown: cuBLASLt fp16 + cp.async under RELAXED capture
— Lt plan cache is warm after warmups, no events in the call);
(2) the 4 device-length pieces + beta/g pad mask; (3) pointer table variants
(append/conv/gdn-state); (4) per-bucket capture at server start + worker
replay path + prime-graph-gate. Prize: 3.7ms/prime (~15%) + freed host.

**Task #14 SMOKE GREEN (2026-07-26): the prime graph WORKS.** prime-graph-smoke
at T=512: capture INSTANTIATES in 13ms (the 340ms fear was the decode-session
snapshot machinery, not capture itself); replay 23.3-24.0ms vs eager 25.7ms
(**+10% immediately, the gap-floor reclaim**) with logits maxdiff 0.000e0 —
BIT-IDENTICAL. Debug ledger for the arc:
1. set_i32_one is a SYNCHRONOUS host memcpy — capture-illegal. Fresh len_d=0
   goes through a memset node instead.
2. Warmups polluted the recurrent state (warmup 2 primed as a continuation)
   and overflowed KV host-lens — fixed by BAKING fresh-prime semantics into
   the graph head: memset nodes zero conv ring + ssm_state(+alt) + len_d and
   host lens reset per closure entry. This is the CORRECT per-replay behavior,
   not a workaround.
3. Retaining an in-capture allocation across end_capture -> INVALID_VALUE at
   instantiate (and AUTO_FREE would UAF it anyway). GRAPH-OUTPUT CONTRACT:
   results copy into caller-preallocated stable buffers; every transient
   drops inside the capture (alloc+free node pairs). prime_chunk_captured
   signature carries the contract.
4. capture_graph_retained's keeper path also trips on the prime; the smoke
   uses manual staged capture — the serving wrapper will too.
REMAINING for serving: per-bucket capture at boot, session pointer TABLE
(this smoke bakes ONE cache's pointers), pad-to-bucket + the 4 device-length
pieces, worker replay path + prime-graph-gate. Replay math: 512/23.3ms =
21,973 tok/s pp512-equivalent (+10.3% over eager 19,922).

**Task #14 design v3 (2026-07-26, post-smoke): COPY-OUT beats the pointer
table.** Economics: one graph per bucket binds a DEDICATED scratch cache;
after replay, D2D-copy the outputs into the session's cache — KV rows [0,T)
(~12MB), conv rings + ssm states (~64MB) ≈ 25-50us total vs the 2.3ms the
graph saves. ZERO kernel changes, ZERO cudaGraphExec node patching (the
160-param patching alternative costs ~320us/session-switch AND graph_update
surgery; copy-out wins on both simplicity and cost). AUTO_FREE LAW (smoke
finding 3 corollary): in-graph transient ADDRESSES recycle per launch — every
replay-consumed output MUST be copy-noded into a stable buffer inside the
graph; the copy-out sources are exactly those stable buffers plus the scratch
cache's resident state.
PAD-PROOFING (the 4 pieces, insertion points pinned):
1. gdn_pad_mask(beta_raw, g_log, len_d, H, T_bucket) — tiny kernel; insert in
   linear_attn_prime_core between the g4 pops and gdn_glog/sigmoid consumers
   (zeroed beta + g_log make pad rows identity state-steps).
2. conv-ring writeback from device true_len (the fresh prime's ring must hold
   rows [len-3, len), not the pad tail) — device-int variant of the ring
   update call in linear_attn_prime_core.
3. row_gather_device(hn/x, len_d) for h_seed + hlast (the smoke gathers row
   T-1 host-side — padded graphs need the true last row).
4. len_d/host-len finalize post-replay (host memcpy, already trivial).
Worker path: buckets {128, 256, 384, 512} captured at boot (13ms each) on the
scratch cache; fresh prime with T <= 512 routes: pad x_in to bucket, memcpy
tokens' embed rows + len_d := T, replay, copy-out, host lens := T. The
prime-batch path (task #13) keeps priority below T=320 at batch >= 2; graphs
serve the singles. Gate: prime-graph-gate (graphed vs eager prime: argmax +
decode-stream + state maxdiff — the prime-batch-gate pattern).

**Task #14 PAD-PROOF GREEN (2026-07-26): the engine core is COMPLETE.**
len_d threaded through the captured prime (gdn_pad_mask after the beta/g
producers, ssm_conv_ring_update_dev writeback, row_gather_dev for
h_seed/hlast — eager paths byte-unchanged via Option<None>). Smoke at
bucket 512 / true_len 300: replayed logits maxdiff 0.000e0 vs the EAGER
300-token prime — pads are provably invisible (identity GDN steps, causal
attention, discarded pad rows), and even the m=512-padded GEMMs bit-match the
m=300 eager run at these shapes. Exact-length case still bit-identical.
Capture 13-15ms; replay 23.2-24.0ms. Remaining = the serving WRAPPER only:
PrimeGraph { graph, scratch cache, x_in/pos_d/len_d/outs } per bucket at
boot, copy-out into session caches (design v3), worker route below the
batch-prime threshold, prime-graph-gate formalization.

**Task #14 gate status (2026-07-26): padded replays GREEN end-to-end; exact-
bucket-length has ONE pinned defect.** prime-graph-gate (eager-vs-graphed
prime + copy-out + 16-step decode streams): T=47/128/300 all MATCH through
decode; copy-out fidelity byte-exact (session==scratch 0.000e0). Findings:
- CONTROL (eager-vs-eager, pool-shifted): streams MATCH — eager is address-
  robust; the graph arm is its own numeric config (keeper-era pool layout ->
  baked Lt addresses -> a different valid rounding; the keeperless smoke
  measured 0.000e0, the retained capture does not).
- Gate convention adopted: prefill argmax MATCH hard + decode divergence
  before step 12 fails (decode_batch config-gate precedent). Smoke-prompt
  T=512 drifts at step 14 = accepted class.
- REMAINING DEFECT: T == bucket with prompt-A diverges at STEP 2 with conv
  max 4.9e-1 (prompt-B: 4.3e-2 / step-14) — prompt-dependent magnitude at
  exact length only; conv-implicated; a real localized bug, NOT the drift
  class. Next bisection: per-LAYER conv/ssm diff at T=512 + T=511 (one pad)
  to isolate the t==bucket edge.
- KEEPER LAW confirmed for primes: capture without the retained keeper leaves
  graph-baked pool addresses reissuable (the earlier corruption class).
SAFE SERVING SUBSET AVAILABLE NOW: replay only for T < bucket (strict pads) —
all green; exact-length primes stay eager pending the fix.

**Task #14 defect hunt — hypothesis kill-list + the live lead (2026-07-26):**
The graphed prime's cache diverges from eager by percent-scale conv values,
deterministically per (prompt, T), while streams still MATCH at all padded
lengths. Killed by experiment: (1) uninit-reads — re-zeroing all 33 prime-path
buffers left every diff BYTE-IDENTICAL; (2) pool-address corruption — keeper
vs keeperless produced identical diffs; (3) copy-out — session==scratch at
0.000e0 everywhere; (4) alignment-lottery — eager-vs-eager pool-shifted
control streams MATCH; (5) launch-stream race — CudaGraph::launch uses the
capturing stream. LIVE LEAD (order experiment): adding an UNRELATED eager
prime BEFORE capture changed a LATER case's outputs (argmax MISMATCH, conv
max 9.8e-2 -> 1.13e1) — replay numerics depend on pre-capture history =
GRAPH-BAKED SHARED MUTABLE STATE. Prime candidate: the engine-resident
f16_scratch (xh activation + 64MB Lt ws) — its pointers bake into the graph's
cvt/Lt nodes while every EAGER f16 GEMM mutates the same buffers between
replays. FIX CANDIDATE (next unit, one file): give the captured prime a
PRIVATE f16 scratch (per-PrimeGraph xh/ws, threaded like len_d) — removes the
sharing entirely. Serving policy meanwhile: graphs stay OFF; the eager+
batch-prime stack (all green) serves.

**Task #14 CLOSING VERDICT (2026-07-26): prime graphs are blocked by
cuBLASLt's address-variant numerics — mechanism identified, reclaim path
priced.** The global discriminator (BW24_DEBUG_ZERO_ALLOCS=1: memset EVERY
engine allocation) left all diffs BYTE-IDENTICAL — contents-independent,
allocation-LAYOUT-dependent. Seven hypotheses tested across the arc (uninit
x2 scopes, pool corruption, keeper, copy-out, alignment-lottery control,
launch stream, shared f16 scratch — the private-scratch isolation MOVED the
diffs, confirming layout sensitivity, but did not remove them). MECHANISM:
Lt/nvjet algos contain pointer-alignment-specialized variants; a baked layout
that differs from eager's seeds ~1e-3 GEMM deviations which the 32-layer
recurrent GDN gating chain AMPLIFIES to percent-scale state diffs — the
keeperless smoke's exact 0.000e0 was the one layout where capture reused the
eager warmups' pool slots verbatim. Consequence: with Lt as the prefill GEMM
engine, a captured prime is an address-lottery numeric config (stream flips
as early as step 2 on synthetic prompts) — below the stream-identity bar
every promoted config met tonight. RECLAIM PATH (priced, not taken): replace
Lt inside captured primes with an address-deterministic fp16 GEMM kernel (a
new kernel arc; MMQ-inside-graph is a net loss: saves 2.3ms gaps, loses ~5ms
GEMM speed). DISPOSITION: prime graphs stay off serving; the machinery
(PrimeGraph, captured trunk, pad-proofing, gates, discriminator flag) is
committed and regression-guarded for when a deterministic GEMM lands. The
serving default remains the all-green eager + batch-prime stack at
pp512 19.9k / +21.6% serving bursts.

**CUTLASS deterministic-GEMM probe (2026-07-26): reclaim path REFUTED at
current rates — the branch is measured, closed, and priced.** tools/
bench_cutlass_f16.cu: sm90 CollectiveBuilder fp16 TN, 7 config sweep
(tiles 128x128/128x256/64x256/256x128, K 64/128, clusters, pingpong/coop/
auto). VERDICT: (1) DETERMINISTIC under address shifts on every shape and
every config — the property Lt lacks, confirmed available; (2) RATE ceiling
0.69-0.75x of Lt (best: default 128x128x64 cluster1x2 auto = 419-514TF vs
nvjet 611-687TF; explicit pingpong pathological at 30TF on this
toolchain/instantiation). ECONOMICS: cutlass-in-graph pays +4ms GEMM tax for
-2.3ms gap savings = net -6% per prime — REFUTED; cutlass-everywhere -30%
GEMM — refuted trivially. The gap-floor reclaim therefore requires a
hand-tuned deterministic fp16 GEMM at >= ~620TF: a CUTLASS-grade kernel
project (weeks-class — tonight's hand-rolled wgmma pipeline history peaked
at ~0.5x Lt). EVERY sub-week avenue in the system now has a measured
endpoint: landed, promoted, or refuted with data.

**CUTLASS int8 probe (2026-07-26, W8A8-reopen check):** default-config sm90
int8 GEMM: 569-780 TOP at model shapes (ffn_down 1.11x vs cublasGemmEx, rest
0.72-0.87x) — DETERMINISTIC everywhere, but nowhere near the ~1300TF-class the
vLLM-35k arithmetic implies (9B x 2FLOP x 35k tok/s = 630TF effective WHOLE
forward => their GEMMs must exceed ~1.1-1.3PF or their FLOP count is lower
than assumed). The inference chain is now suspect — decomposing vLLM's actual
prefill with nsys on this box (their GEMM kernels/us, GDN/FLA kernels, gaps)
to replace inference with measurement before pricing the beat-35k path.

## vLLM decomposed on-box (2026-07-26 nsys) — the lane math changes

Rerun of the engine-decision bench script (same box, same 2048-prompt shape):
**vLLM prefill = 31.0k tok/s TODAY (not the recorded 35k); decode 171.6-176.4
— bw24's 183.7 = 105-107% of vLLM decode (lead widened).** bw24 prefill 19.9k
= 64% of the real number. Their prefill burst per-kernel (nsys):
- nvjet_sm90_tst_256x128 (Lt INT8) ~174us/launch — their GEMM engine is ALSO
  Lt/nvjet, i.e. the SAME address-variant numeric class that blocked our
  monolithic prime graphs;
- flashinfer GDN JIT kernels dominate their busy time (device_kernel 100ms
  class + delta_rule cutlass kernels) — their GDN prefill is EXPENSIVE;
- triton fused int8-quant/norm/silu chains + causal-conv kernels;
- "Capturing CUDA graphs (mixed prefill-decode, PIECEWISE)" — vLLM ships
  graphs WITH nvjet by capturing PIECEWISE: graph the elementwise/state
  chains, call the GEMMs eagerly between graph segments.

**THE UNBLOCKED ROUTE — PIECEWISE PRIME GRAPHS:** our gap floor (3.7ms/prime)
sits in exactly the small-kernel clusters (norms/adds/cvt/GDN glue) that
piecewise capture covers; every one of OUR custom kernels is
address-deterministic (mma/cp.async fixed schedules — only Lt is not).
Graphing the between-GEMM segments (per layer: norm->proj-split glue,
conv/GDN chunk stack, add/norm/silu chains) with Lt GEMMs eager between
segments reclaims most of the floor with ZERO numeric-config change —
bit-identity preserved because the captured kernels are deterministic and
the Lt calls stay exactly as they are. vLLM's own stack validates the
approach on this model/GPU. This is a sub-week arc: segment the captured
trunk at GEMM boundaries, capture each segment once per bucket, replay
segments interleaved with eager GEMM calls.

**Prime activation slabs (2026-07-26): LANDED, honest-neutral standalone,
piecewise foundation in place.** The eager prime's seven trunk transients
(h/x1/z/act/x-pingpong/h16/z16) live in resident per-model slabs
(BW24_PRIME_SLABS=0 reverts): ~224 fewer alloc/free API calls per prime and
FROZEN Lt operand addresses (nvjet variant selection now run-to-run stable —
the property piecewise segment capture requires). pp512 19,826 vs 19,984
slab-less = the third independent launch-diet NEUTRAL (the finding stands:
the floor is submission cadence, not call count). All gates green (validate,
graph-session, prime-batch, argmax MATCH, same output text). NEXT (the
piecewise arc proper): segment the slab-resident layer loop at GEMM
boundaries, capture the deterministic custom-kernel segments per bucket
against the slabs, replay interleaved with eager Lt calls — the vLLM-validated
pattern; slabs give every segment fixed IO addresses for free.

## Piecewise prime graphs — full segmentation design (2026-07-26, build-ready)

Segments contain ONLY cache-free deterministic kernels; EAGER between: every
Lt GEMM, plus the three cache-touching kernels (conv ring update, GDN K4
state pass, KV append) — so segments replay against SESSION caches with no
pointer machinery at all (the monolithic arc's cache problem disappears).

Per-layer sequence (E = eager, S = captured segment):
  S-glue:  [prev-add + attn_norm_f16out]                 (x1,ffn_out -> x_nxt, h, h16)
  E:       qkv / gdn4 GEMM group (xh = h16 slab)         -> proj slabs
  GDN:  S-prep: [conv-window + repack + l2 x2 + sigmoid + glog + K1 + K2 + K3]
        E:      conv-ring update; K4-mma (cache state)
        S-out:  [K5-mma + gated_rmsnorm]                 -> gn slab
  ATTN: S-attn: [q_gate_split + qk-norms + rope + fa_prefill(+gate)]
        E:      KV append
  E:       wo / ssm_out GEMM -> mixed slab
  S-mid:   [add + post_norm_f16out]                      (x_cur,mixed -> x1, z, z16)
  E:       gate/up group -> gate/up slabs
  S-act:   [ffn_act]                                     -> act slab
  E:       down GEMM -> ffn_out slab
Launches/layer: ~16 captured into 4-5 graph launches + ~8 eager calls.

SLAB INVENTORY (all sized at bucket x dim, ~200MB total at bucket 512):
existing 7 (h/x1/z/act/x-pingpong/h16/z16) + boundary slabs: GDN projs
(qkv_mixed 8192, z_g 4096, beta/alpha 2x num_v), attn projs (qf/k/v),
conv_out, q_g/k_g/v_g, q_l2/k_l2, beta/g_log, gcum, A/P (nc*h*c*c), U/W/Y
(nc*h*c*128), ssnap (nc*h*128*128), gn, attn_g, mixed, gate, up, ffn_out.
GEMM `_into` variants (write into slab views — the FFI already takes y
pointers; only the Rust wrappers allocate) for: matmul_group_xh, matmul,
try_f16_gemm_pre.
Capture: ~4 segments x 32 layers x buckets at ~1-3ms each ~= 0.5s boot per
bucket. Replay submits each segment in ONE cuGraphLaunch — attacking the
measured submission-cadence floor directly (the three launch-COUNT neutrals
do not apply: count reduction never fixed cadence; single-call submission
does — vLLM's piecewise pattern on this exact model/GPU is the existence
proof). Projected reclaim ~2-2.5ms/prime (+8-10% pp512) with ZERO numeric
change (all captured kernels address-deterministic; Lt untouched, and slabs
already froze its operands).
Gate: piecewise-vs-eager bit-identity (same kernels, same buffers, same
order — this one CAN be a bit-gate, unlike the monolithic config).

**Piecewise increment 3 (2026-07-26): FIRST SEGMENT LIVE — pp512 crosses 20k.**

keeperless capture is clean here) captured per layer per T, replayed as ONE
cuGraphLaunch each: pp512 19,825 (off) -> 20,009 (on), +0.9% from a 2-kernel
segment x31 layers. BIT-IDENTICAL confirmed (same kernels/buffers/order — the
piecewise config is bit-gateable as designed; argmax/output byte-equal, all
batteries green). The submission-cadence mechanism is VALIDATED: this is the
first launch-structure change that moved the number (three count-reduction
neutrals stand in contrast). Scaling path: S-mid (add+post-norm — needs the
`mixed` slab via the mixer out-GEMM `_into` refactor), then S-prep/S-attn
(7-9 kernels each) per the build-ready segmentation — projected +8-10% total.
BW24_PRIME_SEG=0 reverts.

**Piecewise increment 4 probe (2026-07-26): S-mid-via-copy REFUTED.** Staging
the mixer output into a slab (one 8MB D2D/layer, ~80us/prime + its submission)
costs more than a 2-kernel segment saves: ON 19,870 vs OFF 19,999 (S-glue-only
baseline 20,009). Bit-identical, reverted. The proper S-mid (and every larger
segment) needs the mixer out-GEMM written _into_ the slab directly — the
core-contract refactor (cores return gn/attn_g; prime_chunk runs the out-GEMM
via try_f16_gemm_pre_into) is the gating increment for the remaining +7-9%.
Increment-3 state (S-glue live, pp512 20,009) is the shipped baseline.

**Piecewise increments 3-5 CORRECTED VERDICT (2026-07-26, interleaved A/B):**
the interleaved protocol (the repo's own law, violated in the increment
measurements) refutes the small segments: ON vs OFF interleaved x3 = -1.0%,
-1.2%, +0.0% — a cuGraphLaunch costs about what two kernel submissions do, and
the earlier "+0.9% / pp512 crosses 20k" was CLOCK DRIFT across builds (the
absolute band moved 19.8k -> 20.1k -> 17.7k over the session; only interleaved
comparisons are valid). DISPOSITION: BW24_PRIME_SEG flipped to OPT-IN; the
core-split refactor + slabs + _into plumbing stay (byte-identical, verified,
the foundation for the 7-9-kernel segments whose economics remain open:
~6-7 submissions saved per launch x 24-32 layers ~= 1ms/prime IF the pattern
holds at size). LESSON PINNED: every remaining perf claim in this arc must be
interleaved-A/B measured; cross-run medians are invalid at this session depth.

**Round-26 gap anatomy (2026-07-26, nsys protocol-immune):** clean seq-prime
attribution (batch-arm and gate episodes excluded): in-prime gaps ~0.9-1.7ms,
UNIFORM ~1.5-2.7us launch cadence — no host stalls, no readbacks. Two verdicts:
(1) BIG-SEGMENT ARC REFUTED at this design generation — the graph-launch probe
(tools/bench_graph_launch.cu: launch = 0.8 submissions, in-graph gap saving
~1us/kernel) and the gap anatomy independently bound piecewise segments at
+1-2%, an order below the 8-10% projection; vLLM's piecewise pattern pays for
their PYTHON host, and the Rust host (1.85us/submission) never had that tax.
Task #15 CLOSED (foundation kept, seg opt-in). (2) The anatomy surfaced two
REAL arcs: batch-prime concat/scatter D2D waste (~1ms/round, task #16) and
~50 standalone f16-cvt passes/prime after silu_mul / gated_rmsnorm / attn-gate.

**f16out epilogue fusion (2026-07-26): +1.6% pp512, INTERLEAVED-VERIFIED,
bit-identical, default ON.** silu_mul_f16out / gated_rmsnorm_f16out /
sig_mul_f16out twins emit the downstream GEMM's fp16 operand in-epilogue
(dst16[i] = __float2half(dst[i]) == the cvt kernel's exact bytes; sig_mul also
fuses sigmoid+mul: 3 launches -> 1). Wired: FFN down (silu arm), ssm_out (GDN
wrapper + seg path), wo (attn wrapper + seg path); OFF under verify-exact;
BW24_F16OUT=0 seam. gated twin pins block_dim=128 (reduction-tree law).
Gates: greedy streams BYTE-IDENTICAL on/off (T~200 prime + 64 tok),
kernel-check, validate-h100, prime-batch, graph-session ALL GREEN.
Interleaved A/B x5 (the corrected protocol): ON wins 5/5, median 18620 vs
18328 (+1.6%) — the first interleaved-verified prefill win.

**Batch-prime scatter/gather elimination (2026-07-26, task #16): +6.1%
batched prime, INTERLEAVED-VERIFIED 5/5, gates green.** The round-26 anatomy
showed matmul_group_multi's per-seq split (16MB qkv + 8MB z per GDN layer) and
mixer-output gather were ~1ms/round of pure D2D. Fix: (a) the GDN core is now
view-consuming (linear_attn_prime_core_pad_view; the Vec `_inner` is a shim
making full-range views — every existing caller byte-identical), fed row-offset
CudaViews of the CONCAT projection outputs via view launcher twins
(ssm_conv1d_tm_state_pad_v / sigmoid_v / gdn_glog_v / gated_rmsnorm[_f16out]_zv
— same kernels, same values); (b) both mixer out-GEMMs write straight into the
concat `mixed` trunk at offs[s] via try_f16_gemm_pre_into_off (n_embd-row
offsets preserve the Lt alignment class). Attn q/k/v split copies stay (8
layers, RoPE mutates in place — smaller half of the waste, mapped for later).
Gates: prime-batch-gate b=3/b=4 uneven lengths ALL GREEN (argmax + 16-step
streams MATCH vs individual primes — the offset-view proof), validate-h100,
graph-session, decode-batch green. Interleaved OLD-binary vs NEW x5 at
B=4 T=152 (the serving shape): NEW 5/5, median 14259 vs 13441 (+6.1%).

**Varlen GDN increment 1 (2026-07-26, task #18): K4/K5 varlen pair LANDED,
+2.3% batched prime interleaved 5/5.** gdn_chunk_{state,output}_mma bodies
extracted to __device__ fns; _vl twins take gdnseq_t[8] BY VALUE (the wptr8_t
pattern) + a seq grid dim — ONE launch runs every sequence's K4 (and one K5),
per-block math identical to the per-seq launch (strictly bit-gateable).
Engine: gdn_chunk_k123 extraction (shared, launch-configs untouched),
gdn_chunk_pre (per-seq K1-K3 + mirrors + output allocs), gdn_chunk_vl8 (two
launches), linear_attn_gdn_prep stage split, linear_attn_prime_core_batch
(prep x B -> vl K4+K5 -> per-seq swap/norm; BW24_GDN_VL=0 reverts to per-seq).
Gates: kernel-check, prime-batch b=4 AND b=8 uneven ALL GREEN. Interleaved
seam A/B x5 at B=4 T=152: VL 5/5, median 14488 vs 14164 (+2.3% — the
K4/K5-only slice of the projected varlen total; K1-K3/prep increments next).

**Varlen GDN increment 2 (2026-07-26): K1-K3 varlen — full K1-K5 varlen chain,
+5.5% batched prime interleaved 5/5 (median 14976 vs 14191).** gdnseq_t gained
the K1-K3 operands (k/v/g/a/w; gcum/P/U de-consted — K1/K2/K3 write through the
struct); K2 body extracted (gdn_k2_body), K3 solve template takes `c` as a
param; three _vl kernels (cumgate/attn/solve32) launch every sequence's chunk
grid at once. Engine: gdn_chunk_alloc (alloc-only), gdn_chunk_k123_vl8,
f32_to_bf16 helper; batched core order = per-seq prep + k-mirror -> vl K1-K3
-> per-seq w-mirror -> vl K4/K5. Per-layer GDN core launches at B=4:
52 -> 41 -> now 3 vl + per-seq prep/mirrors. Gates green (kernel-check,
prime-batch b=4/b=8 uneven). Cumulative batched-prime this round:
13441 (pre-#16) -> 14976 (+11.4%). NEXT (increment 3): varlen prep
(conv-with-ring-table, repack, l2, sigmoid/glog) + gated-norm tail.

**Varlen GDN increment 3 (2026-07-26): FULL varlen core — +13.1% batched prime
interleaved 5/5 (median 16022 vs 14171).** The whole GDN mixer core is now 13
launches for the entire batch regardless of B: gdnprep_t table + vl twins for
conv(+ring, per-seq ring pointers in-table), repack, fused l2 (grid.y picks
q/k), fused gate-prep (sigmoid+glog one pass), bf16 mirrors (gdn_mirror_vl over
the gdnseq_t table), and the gated-norm(+f16out) tail — composing with vl
K1-K5. Per-block/element math identical everywhere (bit-gateable); tail vl
requires f16out (else per-seq fallback norm). Gates green (kernel-check,
prime-batch b=4/b=8 uneven). ROUND-26 CUMULATIVE batched serving-shape prime:
13441 -> 16022 (+19.2%: scatter-elim +6.1%, vl-K4/K5 +2.3%, vl-K1-K3 +3%,
vl-prep/tail +7.3%). NOTE: the B=4-12 concat plateau was measured with per-seq
cores — varlen changes B-scaling; re-sweep before touching serving policy.

**Batch-trunk f16out + batched lm_head (2026-07-26): +4.7% batched prime,
interleaved OLD-vs-NEW binaries 5/5 (median 17265 vs 16494).** Two nsys-round-26
residuals: (1) the batch trunk's FFN still paid 32 standalone cvt passes —
silu_mul_f16out + try_f16_gemm_pre now serve it (same #17 bit-identical class);
(2) the epilogue ran B sequential m=1 lm_head matvecs (B re-reads of the 600MB
weight, 2.2ms at B=6) — the B last rows now gather into ONE m=B f16 GEMM + one
DtoH (numeric class = prefill f16 GEMM; prime_batch_gate argmax battery
arbitrates and stays GREEN at b=4/6/8). Also fixed the b^2 hidden-stack split.
ROUND-26 CUMULATIVE batched serving-shape prime: 13441 -> 17265 (+28.4%).

**Varlen FA (2026-07-26, task #18 attn side): +5.7% batched prime, interleaved
5/5 (median 18273 vs 17295).** fa_prefill_bf16kv_vl(+_hd128): favl_t by-value
table + grid.z seq dim over the SAME fa_prefill_f32_pp_body (per-block math
identical — blockIdx.x/y semantics unchanged, tails guarded in-body);
fa_mirror_vl batches the bf16 K/V mirrors (2 launches for the batch, was 2B).
Engine core split: full_attn_prime_core_inner = pre_fa (split/norms/rope/
append) + fa_dispatch + post_fa (single-seq path byte-identical recomposition);
batch arm runs per-seq pre_fa -> ONE vl FA -> per-seq post_fa + wo-into-mixed.
Fresh-only, bf16kv lane, hd 256/128; BW24_FA_VL=0 reverts. Gates green
(kernel-check, prime-batch b=4/6/8 uneven). ROUND-26 CUMULATIVE batched
serving-shape prime: 13441 -> 18273 (+35.9%).

**Varlen attn pre-FA (2026-07-26, task #18 completion): +2.8% batched prime,
attn arm now fully varlen (interleaved arm total 18784 vs 17326 per-seq, 5/5).**
attnpre_t table + four vl kernels: q_gate_split_vl, attn_rms_vl (fused q+k
QK-norm, grid.y picks; rms_block() parity), attn_rope_vl (fused q+k; FRESH
pos == token index — identical value to pos_d[tok]), append_kv_vl (fresh t0=0;
per-block math == the rows append kernel). Inputs are VIEWS of the concat
projections — the attn q/k/v split copies are gone (task #16's mapped
remainder). Host keeps per-seq len/len_d bookkeeping. Gated-arch only
(qwen35); non-gated falls to the per-seq path. Gates green (kernel-check,
validate-h100, graph-session, decode-batch, prime-batch b=4/6/8 uneven).
ROUND-26 FINAL CUMULATIVE: batched serving-shape prime 13441 -> 18784
(+39.8%); serving burst 8284 -> 13907 tok/s (+68%). The batched prime now runs
GEMMs eager (their ceiling) + ~17 varlen launches + trunk glue per layer-pair;
per-seq launch trains are fully retired on both mixer types.

**Conv-fuse (2026-07-26, round 27): +9.7% official prefill lane / +7.8% batched
prime, INTERLEAVED 5/5 both, BIT-IDENTICAL.** The T=2048 anatomy showed
conv (7.2ms) + repack (4.6ms) = 14% of the official lane: a 67MB channel-major
conv_out intermediate written uncoalesced then re-read transposed.
ssm_conv1d_gdn_state_f32 (+_vl twin) fuses carried-ring conv + SiLU + GDN
scatter into ONE pass (the 2026-07-03 zero-state fused kernel finally gets its
state twin) — same 8-tap ascending accumulation, same SiLU, same scatter
mapping => greedy streams byte-identical on/off. Ring update stays separate
(pad-aware, unchanged). BW24_CONV_FUSE=0 reverts; wired in the single-seq prep
AND gdn_prep_vl8. Interleaved x5: T=2048 prime 0.0875s vs 0.096s (5/5);
batched B=6 T=152 20235 vs 18777 (5/5). Full battery green; serving rounds
observed at 45ms/912tok (20.3k) live.
OFFICIAL LANE: prefill T=2048 = 23,406 tok/s (75.4% of vLLM's 31,036, was
69%); TTFT 87.5ms. Batched prime cumulative: 13441 -> 20235 (+50.5%).

**l2 prefill v2 (2026-07-26, round 27): +2.3% official lane / +2.1% batched,
interleaved 5/5 + 3/3.** The 256-thread strided l2 ran 918GB/s on 128-col rows
(half the block idle, scalar loads). l2_norm_pp_v2_f32 + gdn_l2_v2_vl:
warp-per-row, one float4 per lane, shuffle reduce — NUMERIC CONFIG
(explicit+gated BW24_L2_V2, GDN-chunked/mma precedent; reduction tree order
changes). Arbitration: greedy streams MATCH v2-vs-strided (T~200+64 and the
promotion battery 2048-prime -> 128-decode on 2 prompts); kernel-check green.
decode-batch gate1 (config-mode) flipped at step 1 under the v2 prime — the
EXACT documented mma-precedent nuisance (strict bit-gate + gate2 PASS) — fixed
by pinning BW24_L2_V2=0 in the gate's prime alongside BW24_GDN_MMA=0; validate
+ decode-batch ALL GREEN after. PREFILL-ONLY (decode keeps l2_norm_decode).
OFFICIAL LANE: prefill T=2048 = 23,814 tok/s (76.7% of vLLM); batched prime
20,718 (cumulative 13441 -> 20718, +54.1%).

**Mirror folds (2026-07-26, round 27): +1.2% official lane / +2.8% batched vs
the pre-l2v2 baseline arm, interleaved 5/5 + 3/3.** The K4 operand mirrors
(k_l2 -> kb16, W -> wb16 bf16 passes, 915us/prime at T=2048 + 2 launches) are
now emitted BY THEIR PRODUCERS: l2_norm_pp_v2 takes a nullable bf16 twin out
(the k mirror), gdn_chunk_solve32/64 write Wb16 on store (nullable param;
generic C=128 solve untouched). Same __float2bfloat16 values as the standalone
passes (f16out-precedent class); greedy streams MATCH fold-vs-chain.
Threading: GdnPrep.kb16 -> gdn_scan_prefill/chunked kb16_pre (chunked also
pre-allocs wb16 through k123 on the mma path); batched gdnprep_t.kb16 +
solve32_vl unconditional Wb16 — BOTH gdn_mirror_vl launches gone on default
config. Gates: kernel-check, prime-batch b=6/8, decode-batch, validate,
graph-session ALL GREEN.
OFFICIAL LANE: prefill T=2048 = 24,094 tok/s (77.6% of vLLM), TTFT 85ms;
batched prime 20,875 (cumulative 13441 -> 20875, +55.3%).

**FA3 arc OPENED (2026-07-26, round 28): wgmma QK^T tile PROVEN.** Fresh
evidence re-priced the FA rewrite at the official lane shape: fa_prefill at
T=2048 runs 993us/layer = ~3.5% of bf16 TC peak, ncu 11.6% occupancy / 255
regs (register-bound — the refuted occupancy probes could never fix this; only
wgmma's smem-operand reads remove the Q/K register residency). setmaxnreg +
wgmma applies cleanly here: bf16 FA has NO per-block scale folds (the C7514
serialization verdict was specific to Q8 W4A8). tools/bench_fa3.cu (K4/K5
harness playbook): v1 warpgroup m64n64k16 QK^T tile vs CPU ref = MATCH
(1.75e-4) with the s8-probe-proven canonical core-matrix staging (8x16B cores,
element (r,kk) at (r/8)*256+(kk/8)*128+(r%8)*16+(kk%8)*2; desc lead=128
stride=256; trans 0,0). Remaining harness steps: softmax fragment plumbing ->
PV wgmma (P bf16 canonical restage) -> online rescale/causal/GQA -> pipelined
kernel -> BW24_FA3 engine seam. Target: >=3x on the 7.9ms FA slice (+6-7%
official lane).

**FA3 harness v3-v6 + ncu (2026-07-26/27): PARITY reached; the limiter is now
measured.** v3 (full kernel, online-softmax, GQA, causal) correct at all T vs
an online-semantics reference (the two-pass ref mismatch was the shipped
kernel's own P-bf16-at-running-max class — ref aligned). Rates at T=2048:
v3 2872us (serial) -> v4 2327 (int4 cp.async K + 2-stage ring) -> v5 996
(2 warpgroups sharing the K/V ring) ~= the shipped mma kernel's 993us.
v6 (S(t+1)-before-PV(t) intra-warpgroup overlap) REFUTED: 1200us — with two
warpgroups the SM already hides softmax naturally; the reorder's extra syncs
cost more than they buy. ncu(v5): 254 regs -> block-limit-registers 1 CTA/SM,
12.5% occupancy, compute 25% / memory 12% (latency-bound at 8 warps) — v5
reproduces the mma kernel's disease because the 64x256 f32 O accumulator per
warpgroup IS 128 registers. NEXT (the canonical FA3 hd256 shape): split-D —
two warpgroups share ONE q-tile, WG0 computes S+softmax+P (bP is already the
broadcast medium), both PV their 128-col D-half (O = 64 regs each); then
setmaxnreg asymmetric allocation (WG0~168/WG1~88 = half the file -> 2 CTAs/SM,
16 warps). Target unchanged: >=2x over 993us => +4-6% official lane.

**FA3 harness v7 verdict (2026-07-27): split-D REFUTED at this structure —
1392us (WG1 fully idles behind WG0's serialized S+softmax; 172KB smem still
caps 1 CTA/SM, so the register win buys nothing). ARC STATE after 7 versions:
v5 (2 q-tiles x 2 warpgroups, shared K/V ring, int4 cp.async, canonical
core-matrix wgmma) = 999us == the shipped mma kernel (993us), correct at all
T vs the online-semantics reference. Three refutations with mechanisms (v6
overlap reorder: natural WG interleave already covers it; v7 split-D: WG1
starvation + smem cap). WHAT BEATING 993 REQUIRES (priced): the full FA3
producer/consumer discipline — a dedicated producer warpgroup on TMA with
setmaxnreg (32/160 reg split), smem diet to 2 CTAs/SM, and cluster-level KV
multicast for the GQA share. Foundations all proven in tools/bench_fa3.cu
(wgmma bf16 descriptors, staging, online softmax fragment plumbing, GQA,
causal) — the remaining work is choreography, not discovery. The mma kernel's
993us stands as a well-tuned baseline: it earns its rate from deep ILP within
64 warps, which wgmma can only beat with occupancy the naive shapes can't
reach.**

**FP8-for-Q8_0 assessment (2026-07-27): NOT the lane lever.** BW24_PP_FP8
serves F8-E4M3-ORIGIN checkpoints (raw e4m3 bytes + per-tensor scale). For the
Q8_0 model a Q8_0->e4m3 mirror is a NEW lossy hop: e4m3's 3 mantissa bits +
per-TENSOR scale cannot carry Q8_0's per-32-block scale spread (Lt fp8
supports scalar/outer-vec scales only — the same per-block-scale wall as the
C7514/W8A8 verdicts). Rates would also be shape-limited like the int8 probe
(654-892 TOP at m=512, not the 2x datasheet). A5 stays scoped to F8
checkpoints.

## FA3 v8 design (build-ready — the choreography, all pieces proven)
1. Host: cuTensorMapEncodeTiled for K/V [T, HKV*D] bf16, box (64, 64) x 4
   per-D-quarter maps OR box (64,256) with 128B swizzle; pass as
   __grid_constant__ CUtensorMap. Q likewise (loaded once).
2. Kernel CTA = 384 thr: WG0/WG1 consumers (v5's 2-q-tile shape — the proven
   best), WG2 producer. setmaxnreg: consumers .inc 216, producer .dec 40
   (2x128x216 + 128x40 = 60.4K regs < 64K, 1 CTA — the win is producer
   latency-hiding + consumer spill-freedom, smem caps 1 CTA regardless).
3. Producer loop: cp.async.bulk.tensor.2d [smem ring stage], [tmap, {k0, kvh
   base}], mbar; arrive_expect_tx per stage. Ring: 2 stages x (K 32KB + V
   32KB) as v5. V^T handled by a SECOND tensor map with element-stride swap
   (TMA im2col not needed — transpose staged via 128B-swizzle map read along
   the other axis) OR keep V^T scalar staging in the producer (it hides).
4. Consumers: mbarrier.try_wait parity loop instead of cp_wait/syncthreads;
   descriptors switch to swizzle-mode bits matching the TMA layout (desc bits
   62-63 = 1 for 128B swizzle; LBO/SBO change per PTX table — iterate with the
   harness QK^T probe EXACTLY like the canonical layout was cracked).
5. Gate: harness vs online-ref at all T (existing battery), then engine
   integration behind BW24_FA3 with the greedy-stream battery.
Expected: producer removes the staging serialization v5 still pays inside its
consumer warpgroups; with consumers never idling on K/V, the wgmma chain
approaches its issue-bound floor. Measured points to beat: v5 999us, engine
993us; the slice is 7.9ms of the 85ms official-lane prime.

**FA3 v8a (2026-07-27): producer warpgroup w/o setmaxnreg REFUTED — 1562us.
Mechanism: __launch_bounds__(384) forces a 170-reg ptxas ceiling onto the
254-reg consumer path -> local-memory spills eat the producer's gain. The
named-barrier choreography itself is CORRECT (all T MATCH) and stays as the
v8 skeleton. THE remaining unknown is one specific contract: how CUTLASS-class
kernels compile consumer code at ~240 regs while launching 384 threads
(setmaxnreg.inc/dec + the launch-time register check interplay — study
cutlass::arch::warpgroup_reg_{alloc,dealloc} codegen and the .maxnreg PTX
annotation before the next attempt). Harness scoreboard: v5 999us == engine
993us stands; v6/v7/v8a refuted with mechanisms. Everything else on the
official lane is at its measured wall; the lane sits at 77.6% of vLLM with
this one arc open.

**FA3 v8b/v8c + setmaxnreg contract CRACKED (2026-07-27).** The contract
(tools/probe_setmaxnreg.cu, probe-verified on the box): __launch_bounds__
caps the ENTRY count (168x384 = the full file, passes the launch check, which
is static-entry x threads — setmaxnreg does NOT relax it); setmaxnreg.dec/inc
redistribute the fixed CTA pool at runtime; ptxas REGION-ALLOCATES post-inc
code above the entry count (0 spills at 192 live floats) — but only when the
inc sits at the TOP of the consumer path (a shared-region if/else placement
spilled 560B; v8b). v8c (clean regs, 12B spills): 1829us — the producer shape
itself is refuted at this geometry: named-barrier round-trips (consumer FULL
wait + producer cp.wait-then-EMPTY wait) serialize worse than v5's
hardware-scoreboard soft pipelining. FA3 remaining recipe, three refutations
narrower: TMA bulk-tensor with mbarrier completion (producer never self-waits)
+ >=3-deep rings + the cracked setmaxnreg split. v5 999us == engine 993us
stands as the harness floor; official lane holds at 77.6% with this single
arc open and every step of it evidence-priced.

**FA3 v9 (2026-07-27): async-producer mbarriers CORRECT but 1830us == v8 —
the sync mechanism was never the wall.** Debug ledger: cp.async.mbarrier.arrive
DEFAULTS to self-balancing (increments pending before arriving — deadlocks a
fixed-count mbarrier); the .noinc variant is the producer-signal form. With
that fixed, v9 matches v8 exactly, and the real differentiator surfaces:
ptxas C7515 fires on BOTH 3-WG variants ("wgmma serialized — non-wgmma
instructions define accumulator registers inside the pipeline stage") but NOT
on v5 — at the 240-reg setmaxnreg region the compiler stops pipelining the PV
wgmma chain around the oacc-alpha rescale, halving tensor throughput. ARC
LEDGER after 9 versions: v5 (999us == engine 993us) is the floor; 5 refuted
shapes each with a mechanism (v6 reorder, v7 split-D, v8a spills, v8b/c
barrier-serial + C7515, v9 mbarrier + C7515). The remaining recipe is now
COMPILER-SHAPE work: keep the PV accumulator chain free of interleaved scalar
defs under the 240-reg region (restage alpha via smem or pre-scaled P), or
TMA+128B-swizzle to cut the staging instructions the producer exists to hide.
Foundations (descriptors, canonical staging, online softmax, GQA, setmaxnreg
contract, mbarrier signaling incl. the .noinc lesson) are all proven in
tools/bench_fa3.cu and reusable for ANY future warp-specialized kernel.

**FA3 reg-sweep coda (2026-07-27): C7515 is STRUCTURAL to setmaxnreg, not the
reg value (240/216/192 all fire it; timing flat 1826-1831us). Decisive
cross-comparison already in the ledger: v8a (NO setmaxnreg, 560B spills) =
1562us BEATS v8c/v9 (setmaxnreg, clean regs) = 1830us — the setmaxnreg
instruction's presence degrades ptxas's wgmma pipelining by MORE than the
spills it prevents. COMPILER FINDING PINNED for all future warp-specialized
work on this toolchain (CUDA 13.1): setmaxnreg + interleaved scalar
accumulator defs = serialized wgmma chains; CUTLASS avoids this by keeping
consumer mainloops scalar-free between wgmma stages (P pre-scaled, alpha via
smem multipliers folded into operands). Producer/consumer at this tile
geometry: 6 variants refuted; v5 (2 consumer WGs, cooperative staging,
999us == engine 993us) is the definitive shape for this generation. Remaining
FA3 paths, priced: (a) C7515-free consumer bodies (fold alpha into P before
restage — P' = P, O-rescale via a separate smem-staged multiply outside the
wgmma window), (b) TMA+128B-swizzle inside the v5 shape. The official lane
holds at 77.6% with this as the sole open arc.

**add+norm f16out fusion (2026-07-27): landed, honest-small.** The prefill
trunk's residual-add + norm pairs now run as add_rms_norm_f16out_f32 (the
add_rms_norm_f32 decode precedent, f16out twin) at 3 trunk sites (prime x2,
batch x1). Streams BYTE-IDENTICAL vs the separate pair (old-binary gate);
kernel-check + prime-batch green. Measured: batched +0.17% (4/5, inside
noise); single-seq arithmetic ~+0.6% at T=2048 (one 33MB re-read saved per
site x64, below the ms display floor). KEPT: bit-identical, strictly less
traffic and launches — the launch-diet class.

**TMA foundation PROVEN (2026-07-27, tools/probe_tma.cu): MATCH first run.**
Host cuTensorMapEncodeTiled (2D bf16, box 64x64, no swizzle) + __grid_constant__
CUtensorMap + cp.async.bulk.tensor.2d.shared::cluster.global.mbarrier::
complete_tx::bytes + mbarrier.arrive.expect_tx / try_wait.parity — byte-exact
box load verified. EVERY primitive for FA3 v10 is now individually proven in
this repo: wgmma bf16 descriptors + canonical staging (bench_fa3 v1), online
softmax fragment plumbing (v2), the full kernel (v3-v5, parity), setmaxnreg
contract (probe_setmaxnreg), mbarrier producer signaling incl. .noinc
(bench_fa3 v9), TMA (probe_tma). Remaining v10 assembly: swizzled tensor maps
(SWIZZLE_128B) paired with swizzle-mode wgmma descriptors (desc bits 62-63,
iterate LBO/SBO with the existing QK^T probe exactly as the canonical layout
was cracked), TMA staging inside the v5 2-consumer shape (no third warpgroup —
that lesson is paid for). This is the sole open arc on the sole trailing lane.

**SWIZZLE PAIRING CRACKED (2026-07-27, probe_tma.cu sweep): TMA SWIZZLE_128B
tiles pair with wgmma descriptors at swizzle-mode bits = 1 (bit 62), SBO=1024,
LBO IGNORED (0/1/16/128 all MATCH, max_rel 8.2e-4), k16-slice selection via
descriptor base + j*32 bytes within the 8KB atom. With this, EVERY v10
primitive is individually proven: swizzled TMA loads (this probe), wgmma on
swizzled tiles (this probe), canonical-layout wgmma (bench_fa3 v1), online
softmax + full kernel (v2-v5, parity floor 999us), setmaxnreg contract
(probe_setmaxnreg + the C7515 caveat), mbarrier signaling (v9 + .noinc).
v10 = assemble TMA staging into the v5 two-consumer shape (Q/K via swizzled
maps; V^T needs a transposed map or keeps scalar staging) — zero unknowns
remain, only assembly and the interleaved verdict.

**FA3 v10: THE KERNEL WINS (2026-07-27) — 883us vs the shipped 993us (+12.5%),
correct at all T.** TMA swizzled Q/K inside the v5 two-consumer shape: 3D
tensor maps (dims {D,heads,T}, box {64,1,64}, SWIZZLE_128B), single-thread
TMA issue per ring stage with expect-tx mbarriers (EMPTY re-arm guards),
swizzled S-phase descriptors (mode=1/SBO=1024, k16 slice = atom+j*32), V^T
cooperative-scalar and the PV path canonical as before. Harness ladder:
2872 (v3) -> 2327 (v4) -> 999 (v5, parity) -> 883 (v10, +12.5% over the
engine kernel). Projected official-lane slice: FA 7.9 -> ~7.0ms (~+1.1% lane)
BEFORE the remaining v10 headroom (V^T staging via a transposed map, 3-deep
ring, C7515-free shapes now applicable in a winning structure).
NEXT: engine integration behind BW24_FA3 (per-call cuTensorMapEncodeTiled on
the mirror buffers ~us-scale host cost x8 layers; the greedy-stream battery +
interleaved A/B arbitrate), then the vl (batched) twin via grid.z.

**FA3 v10 ENGINE-INTEGRATED + PROMOTED (2026-07-27, round 29): the shipped FA
is now the wgmma/TMA kernel — official lane 0.085 -> 0.083s (5/5), 24,675
tok/s = 79.5% of vLLM, TTFT 83ms.** cu/fa3_prefill.cu (static-lib kind, links
the driver API; non-90a arches build a fail-closed stub): per-call
cuTensorMapEncodeTiled on the bf16 q/k mirrors + the harness-proven kernel.
Dispatch arm in fa_prefill (fresh causal hd256; q/k/v bf16 mirrors incl. the
new q mirror). NEW NUMERIC CONFIG promoted per the GDN-mma bar: 3-seed
2048-prime -> 128-decode streams MATCH vs mma, full battery green under
FA3=1 AND under defaults post-promotion; decode-batch gate got the third
documented prime-config pin (BW24_FA3=0 alongside GDN_MMA/L2_V2).
BW24_FA3=0 reverts; hd128 twin + batched favl twin remain mapped.
The FA3 arc: opened, cracked, WON, and shipped in one campaign — 10 harness
versions, 4 permanent unlocks, 6 mechanism-verdicts, +2.4% on the official
lane with headroom mapped (V^T map, 3-deep ring, C7515-free bodies).

**FA3 v11 SHIPPED (2026-07-27, round 30): full-TMA staging + trans_b PV —
205us in-harness (4.8x the old kernel), official lane 0.085 -> 0.079s (5/5,
+7.6%) = 25,924 tok/s = 83.5% of vLLM, TTFT 79ms.** The PV trans_b pairing
(probe_tma sweep: SBO=1024, k-slice = base + j*2048, trans_b=1 over TMA
row-loaded V) eliminated v10's remaining wall — the 16K-scalar-load V^T
transpose staging per tile (the engine kernel's original staging disease in
miniature). Kernel: Q/K/V all TMA swizzled through one expect-tx ring; PV
consumes V atoms MN-major via the trans bit. Engine shim upgraded in place
(3 maps/call); promotion bar re-run: 3-seed long streams MATCH, validate ALL
GREEN, interleaved 5/5. Harness ladder final: 2872 -> 999 (parity) -> 883
(v10) -> 205 (v11). FA slice: 7.9ms -> ~1.6ms of the official lane.

**Device embed gather (2026-07-27, round 30): +12.4% official lane, 5/5 —
29,050 tok/s = 93.6% of vLLM, TTFT 70ms (theirs 66).** The post-v11 host
attribution found the lane's largest remaining cost OUTSIDE the kernels: the
CPU embed row-gather + 31MB pageable HtoD (~9ms of the 79ms protocol prime at
T=2048 — the gather memcpy itself, not just the copy). The gemma4 machinery
(embd_gpu resident quantized table + embed_gather_device_td) adopted for every
model in HybridModel::embed — token ids htod (8KB) + device dequant-gather,
same d*q math, greedy streams MATCH device-vs-host. BW24_EMBED_DEV=0 reverts.
Full battery green. The lane is now within 6.4% of vLLM with GEMMs (52% of
kernel time) at their probe-refuted ceiling; remaining mapped: de-broadcast
(~1.5ms), gaps (~1.4ms), K4 Ssnap (~0.4ms), FA3 batched twin (serving).

**Lt algo sweep at m=2048 (2026-07-27): GEMM ceiling RECONFIRMED at the lane's
real shape.** Heuristic #0 (the engine's pick) is optimal or within jitter on
5/6 shapes; gate/up (k=4096,n=11008) shows algo#2 ~4% inside noise (re-time
variance +-2-9% on the same algo). No algo-cache warranted. The official-lane
GEMM slice (36.4ms, 52% of kernel time) stands at its dtype-refuted ceiling.
LANE MAP to parity (70ms vs vLLM's 66): de-broadcast q/k (~1.2ms,
bit-identical, wide edit across conv-scatter/l2/K2/K4/K5 + vl twins), gap
floor (~1.4 of 2.4ms), K4 Ssnap smem staging (~0.4ms) — sum ~= 3ms => ~99%.
The last ~1% is vLLM's int8-vs-fp16 GEMM edge at these shapes, refused by the
accuracy laws (per-block-scale walls, probes on file).

**De-broadcast q/k (2026-07-27, round 31, task #21): +1.4% official lane
(5/5) / +1.7% batched (3/3), BYTE-IDENTICAL streams.** q/k now store num_k=16
distinct GQA heads ([T,16,128]) instead of the num_v=32 broadcast; every
consumer takes an explicit hk param with h%hk mapping (hk==H provably
reproduces the old indexing — harness bins pass hk=H). Producer layout decided
ONCE in prep (gdn_hk: db && chunked && t>=16 && mma && num_k*2==num_v);
s128/verify/diff paths assert broadcast. Touched: fused conv scatter(+vl),
K2 body(+vl), K3 template(+vl, generic asserted broadcast-only), K4 kb16
staging(+vl), K5 q staging(+vl), l2 rows, kb16 sizes, chunked mirror sizing.
BW24_GDN_DB=0 reverts. Full battery green.
OFFICIAL LANE: 29,257 tok/s = 94.3% of vLLM, TTFT 70ms (theirs 66).
Remaining map: K4 Ssnap (~0.4ms), FA3 batched favl twin (serving), gap floor
(segments re-refuted by construction — add_rms fusion made them 1-kernel spans).

**FA3 batched vl twin (2026-07-27, round 31): +0.7% batched (5/5, median
20993 vs 20850), gates green.** bw24_fa3_vl: per-seq tensor maps BY VALUE
(3 x 8 x 128B param structs), grid.z = seq over the same v11 body — the last
mma-favl consumer replaced. Serving FA now wgmma/TMA end to end. (Ops note:
mid-round the box went unreachable — ISP rotated the egress IP; SG rule
egress rule rotated to the new /32, old rule revoked.)

**K4 Ssnap column-block layout (2026-07-27, round 32): landed, honest-small
(~0.3-0.4ms at the ms display floor; round-1 read 0.069 vs 0.070s).** The
mapped fragment-scatter slack: Ssnap now [4 col-blocks][128r][32c] per (c,h)
— each CTA's slice writes one contiguous 8KB block (was 256B-strided 4B
pairs); K5's ST stage reads the matching addressing. Streams IDENTICAL vs the
row layout; kernel-check (f64-truth K4/K5 pins) green; full battery green.
The lane map is now EXHAUSTED above the ms floor: every mapped item landed or
mechanism-refuted; the official lane stands at ~94.3-95% of vLLM with the
residual being the int8-GEMM dtype edge (probed at m=512 AND m=2048, refused
by the accuracy laws).

## GDN chunk stack wgmma arc OPENED (2026-07-27, round 32) — the lane-crosser
The hook-forced re-examination under the FA3 learnings invalidates the
"post-mma wall" comfort: the GDN chunk kernels run at SINGLE-DIGIT percent of
tensor peak (K4: 4.3 GF/layer in 233us = 2%; K2/K3/K5 the same class) —
12.4ms of the 70ms lane. They are small-GEMM chains with the exact structure
FA3 cured (sequential tiles + state, independent heads): K2 = k.k^T + q.k^T,
K4 = W.M + ys^T.k with M in accumulators, K5 = q.St + P.Y. The toolkit maps
1:1: wgmma m64n64k16 packing 2 HEADS per m64 (heads independent — the
parallelism wgmma needs), canonical/swizzled staging (descriptors cracked),
TMA + expect-tx rings, and the state-in-fragments precedent K4-mma already
established. Numeric class: bf16 wgmma = the PROMOTED mma config; the same
state-carry battery arbitrates. Playbook: tools/bench_gdn_wgmma.cu harness ->
K4 pair-of-heads tile proof -> chunk chain -> K5 -> K2 -> BW24_GDN_WGMMA seam.
Target: 12.4 -> ~4-5ms => official lane ~62ms vs vLLM's 66 — THE CROSSING.
Every primitive is already proven in-repo; this is assembly, per the FA3
v10/v11 experience (which went from primitives to shipped in one block).

**K4-wgmma design note (resolved before harness):** wgmma operands come from
SMEM only — M cannot stay in accumulators across steps like the mma kernel
does. Resolution: M lives as wgmma ACCUMULATOR for step B (+= ys^T.k,
scale_d=1) and round-trips fragment->smem(bf16) once per chunk for step A's B
operand — 32KB smem-local traffic per chunk (19TB/s on-SM, never HBM) = noise.
Head packing in m64 is IMPOSSIBLE for step A (B = M is per-head); the m=32
rows ride m64 with 50% pad — wgmma's 4-8x per-instruction rate over the mma
path still nets 2-4x. Grid: (head, n-col-block) as today for fill. Harness
first (tools/bench_gdn_wgmma.cu): CPU ref + current-kernel calibration +
step-A tile proof with the proven canonical descriptors.

## K4-wgmma v2: full chain IN-BAND, first timing 210.9µs (2026-07-27)

Harness `tools/bench_gdn_wgmma.cu` v2 = full K4 chain (16 chunks, state carry, Ssnap
column-block writes) per CTA = (head, 64-col block), 128 threads, M lives in Macc[2][32]
fragments across chunks. Step A: canonical A(sW) × canonical B(sM, fragment→bf16 restage
per chunk); step B: canonical A(sYs = gk-folded ys^T) × canonical B(sK = k transposed at
stage time, n=i k=j). Two refutations en route:
- trans_b with a NON-swizzled canonical descriptor is not a thing (PV pairing is proven
  only for TMA swizzled atoms) — plus the nb·2048 offset collided with k-slices. k^T
  canonical restage fixed both: state bad 521184 → in-band.
- Harness inputs must follow the bench_gdn_k4 law (W scale 0.3, gcum continuous cumsum,
  metric = maxdiff/max|ref| band 3e-2). The recurrence amplifies ×4/chunk by design of
  that gate (scale reaches 6e8 — f32 Y mandatory; f16 Y overflows at chunk 8).
Verdict: Y rel 1.036e-2, state rel 7.804e-3 — IN-BAND (bf16 class). Timing 210.9µs vs
shipped mma 68.3µs at H=32 T=512 C=32: grid is 64 CTAs on 132 SMs (≤48% machine) and one
warpgroup serializes stage→wgmma→wait×2 per chunk. Optimization arc open: vectorized
staging, W/k prefetch, m64n32 flip (j=32 real rows sit in the padded m-half), cluster
DSMEM i-split for CTA doubling.

## K4-wgmma v3/v4 optimization arc: 210.9 -> 70.3µs; micro-lever space exhausted (2026-07-27)

Ladder (all in-band, class metric): v2 210.9 (64 CTAs, 1 wg) -> v3 116.6 (col-32 grid = 128
CTAs + 16B staging vectorization) -> v4 82.3 (2 warpgroups x i-halves: per-wg step-A partials
+ smem exchange, split step-B atoms; ncu was 1.0 active warps/scheduler, no-eligible 86.5%)
-> 73.7 (U register prefetch under staging shadow; phase probe: epilogue was 27.8µs of 82.4)
-> 70.3 (cp.async W staging, real rows only, pad zeroed once). Shipped mma harness = 68.3µs.

REFUTED (each ~+7..+36µs, this toolchain punishes form changes near wgmma):
- staging under wgmma/epilogue shadows (x3: v3 hoist, v4 wg1-under-epilogue, lambda forms)
- float2 exchange (bank replays), Ssnap smem-tile coalesced flush (global 2B scatter is NOT
  the pole - fire-and-forget hides), split epilogue w/ bidirectional exchange (sW-overlay
  aliasing), dedicated sP buffer + per-thread gk expf (+7).
Phase map at 73.8: staging 27.2 (after uPre moved in), epilogue 19, wgmma A+B ~5, snap 1.2.

VERDICT: v4-shape floor ~70µs = wash vs shipped mma K4. Tensor work is 1.5% of bf16 peak —
K4 standalone is a latency problem, not a tensor problem. The wgmma play that PAYS is fusion:
M lives in Macc registers at snapshot time -> fuse K5's per-chunk consumption of Ssnap into
the persistent-M kernel and kill the Ssnap global round-trip on both sides (K5 = 3.1ms of the
12.4ms stack; K4+K5 = 8.4ms of 12.4). Next: K5 semantics + fusion design.

## K4+K5 fusion (v5): proven in-band, 91.3µs fused vs 70.4 K4-only (2026-07-27)

`gdn_k45_wgmma_v5` absorbs K5's output pass into the persistent-M chunk kernel:
- phase 1 (o = exp(gcum_j)·q_j·M_pre[col]) rides step A's commit group — same B operand
  (sM[wg]); partials exchanged via a second overlay (sQ) in the SAME barrier window.
- phase 2 (o += P·Y) rides step B's group. KEY REWIRE: gk folds into sK staging (per-thread
  expf at k-transpose time), so sYs holds PLAIN Y^T and serves step B's A AND phase 2's B.
- Ssnap global round-trip DELETED on both sides (M already on-SM at snapshot time).
Verdict: Y 1.071e-2, state 1.030e-2, O 1.077e-2 — IN-BAND (band 3e-2). 91.3µs at H=32
T=512 C=32; marginal K5 absorption = 20.8µs vs ~32µs standalone K5 (T=512-scaled from the
3.1ms/24-layer ledger figure) + Ssnap traffic + a launch.

Findings en route:
- C7519: wgmma inside a warpgroup-divergent path serializes (ptxas WG.AR). Run phase-2 on
  BOTH wgs, discard wg1's result; gate only the stores. (C7515's sibling — goes in memory.)
- Register-path staging of q (f32→bf16 canonical) + P (masked) was SUPER-ADDITIVE poison:
  q-skip −53µs, P-skip −47µs, both-skip −69µs (145.7→76.9). Not spills (0B) — issue-window/
  scheduling pathology. Fix: bf16 mirrors (qb16 like kb16; Pb16 pre-masked) + cp.async 16B
  in the W commit group → 145.7 → 91.3. Engine seam: prep emits qb16; P producer emits
  masked bf16 mirror (both precedented by kb16/dst16).
- cp.async issued after a commit_group belongs to NO group — wait_group misses it (O inf
  until a second commit_group after the q/P loop).
Next: engine seam BW24_GDN_WGMMA (fused kernel into hybrid.cu, qb16/Pb16 mirrors in prep,
Ssnap/K5-launch removal on the gated path), kernel-check + state battery + lane A/B ×5.

## BW24_GDN_WGMMA promoted default-ON hopper (2026-07-27)

Engine seam shipped: `gdn_k45_wgmma` in hybrid.cu (sm_90a-guarded, hk-mapped, Y/Ssnap never
materialized — their only consumer was K5, now in-kernel), qb16 mirror via f32_to_bf16_bulk,
Pb16 pre-masked mirror via new `gdn_p_bf16_masked`, dispatch nested in the GDN-mma branch.
Battery (all green): harness in-band incl. tail chunks (T=200: O rel 5.6e-3); argmax gate
PASS; greedy IDENTICAL on 3 distinct ~1.6-2k-token primes (real model, hk=16 de-broadcast);
chunked-continuation (BW24_PRIME_CHUNK=512) IDENTICAL; kernel-check ALL GREEN with a new
WGMMA-fused config pin (out band 4e-1 — measured 2.19e-1: fused phase 1 stages q/M as bf16
where K5-mma staged fp16, a legitimately wider class; state 8e-1 shared with mma class);
decode-batch gate green (BW24_GDN_WGMMA=0 pinned there, nuisance pattern). Official
single-seq prefill lane interleaved x5 at pp2017: off mean 25604.7 -> on mean 25793.6 tok/s,
+0.74%, on wins 5/5 rounds. Promoted default-ON via cfg!(bw24_hopper_mma); =0 reverts.
Chunk-stack arc continues: K2 cumgate + K3 solve remain; v5 marginal costs (sO exchange
~11µs, O store ~14µs at T=512 dims) are the next fusion-side targets.

## K2-wgmma shipped inside BW24_GDN_WGMMA: lane +2.56% cumulative (2026-07-27)

`gdn_k2_wgmma` replaces the 87µs/layer f32 K2: A = kk^T and P = qk^T as two m64n64k16
chains per (chunk, head) CTA — canonical A and B layouts COINCIDE, so one cp.async-staged
k tile serves as A of kk^T and B of both GEMMs; qb16/kb16 mirrors hoisted above K123; K2
writes the pre-masked Pb16 directly (gdn_p_bf16_masked pass deleted). A keeps the old
contract (only i<j written; upper stays stale for the solve). Battery: kernel-check ALL
GREEN (fused pin out 2.19e-1 -> 2.32e-1, state 5.30e-1 -> 5.48e-1 — A-bf16 through the
depth-32 solve barely widens the class); 3-seed greedy IDENTICAL; chunked-continuation
IDENTICAL; decode-batch green. Lane A/B interleaved x5 at pp2017: off 25648.9 -> on
26304.3 tok/s = +2.56%, on wins 5/5 (fusion alone was +0.74%; K2 added ~+1.8%).
Chunk stack remaining: solve32 92µs (sequential-triangular, wgmma-hostile), conv ~160µs,
k45 marginal (sO exchange, O store). Official-lane estimate: 94.3% -> ~96.7% of vLLM.

## Varlen twins of the wgmma-fused pair: batched prime +3.8% (2026-07-27)

`gdn_k45_wgmma_vl` + `gdn_k2_wgmma_vl` (bodies refactored out of the per-seq kernels;
per-block math identical -> the vl-vs-per-seq relationship stays strictly bit-gateable).
Per-seq wgmma extras ride a NEW side-struct `gdnw_t/gdnwvl_t` (Rust GdnWVl/GdnWVl8) so
gdnseq_t stays untouched; GdnChunkBufs grows qb16/pb16; the batch driver builds qb16
mirrors and hands Option<&GdnWVl8> through k123_vl8/chunk_vl8 (K2-vl replaces attn_vl;
one fused launch replaces state_mma_vl + output_mma_vl; Y/Ssnap dead on this path too).
Gates: prime-batch (B=3 uneven lengths — vl tails), decode-batch, kernel-check ALL GREEN.
Batched prime interleaved x5 (--bench 1024, B=3): off 27074.7/27242.4/27288.3/27303.9/
27307.4 -> on 28442.5/28041.9/28084.6/28323.5/28342.2 = +3.8% mean, on wins 5/5 (larger
than single-seq's +2.56%: xB launch dilution also dies).

## K3 solve32 arc — design note (2026-07-27, pre-work)

Current: 92µs/layer f32 forward substitution, grid (NC, H) x 256 (1 col/thread, hist in
regs, depth-32 serial FMA chain ~496 dependent FMAs). Latency-bound, not FLOP-bound.
Route A (tensor-core): (I+L)^{-1} = (I−L)(I+L²)(I+L⁴)(I+L⁸)(I+L¹⁶) for strictly-lower
L (nilpotent at 32): 4 squarings + 4 products (32x32x32) + 2 applications (32x128) per
(chunk, head) — all GEMMs, 2016-way parallel. RISK: bf16 through 5 chained products vs
f32 substitution — likely needs the tf32 wgmma kind (m64n64k8.f32.tf32, 4B canonical
layout UNPROVEN on this toolchain — new probe required) or f32 accumulate splits.
Route B (SIMT latency): merge 2 (c,h) pairs per CTA / raise CTAs-per-SM to cut waves.
Decide by measuring wave count first (occupancy of gdn_chunk_solve32_f32).

## K3 solve32 Route B REFUTED; bit-identity mechanism found (2026-07-27)

The ILP-split substitution (presums off the cross-j path, 4-way chains, last-term-only
serial link) measured 48.8 -> 55.1µs at T=1101 — SLOWER (reg pressure/adds beat the chain
relief) — AND broke prime-batch-gate: with reassociation freedom in the source, ptxas
schedules the per-seq and vl instantiations of gdn_chunk_solve_kernel<32> DIFFERENTLY,
breaking their bit-identity. The simple `acc -=` chain pins evaluation order, which is
WHY the repo's vl-vs-per-seq bit-gates hold at all. Reverted; gates green again.
Solve remaining route: tensor-core inverse product (I−L)(I+L²)(I+L⁴)(I+L⁸)(I+L¹⁶) —
needs tf32 wgmma probe first (bf16 through 5 chained products is a numerics risk).
K45 remains the top kernel item (339µs/layer = 11% of lane): TMA swizzled-atom staging
(FA3-proven descriptors) for sW/sQ + exchange redesign is the next arc.

## v6 (exchange-free duplicate-full-k) REFUTED (2026-07-27)

Hypothesis: tensor pipe at ~16% makes duplicating FULL-k step A + phase 1 on both wgs
free -> exchange machinery (sS/sO overlays + 2 barriers) dies, epilogue/O-store split by
column halves. Measured: 91.0 -> 114.1µs (in-band, bit-same class). Split commit groups
with wait<1> under the epilogue changed nothing (114.2 -> 114.1). Mechanism: doubling
per-wg wgmma chains doubles smem OPERAND traffic (both wgs stream all of sM/sQ instead
of halves) — operand bandwidth, not accumulator waits, prices small-tile wgmma here.
ptxas C7514/C7517 emitted on the dual-chain form. The v5 exchange design is the local
optimum; current k45 phase map: O store 13.3, sO exchange 10.8, q cp.async 8.7, staging
~0 (hidden), epilogue ~0 (uPre). Next candidates: tf32-wgmma probe (solve Route A
prerequisite), FA3-style TMA/mbarrier ring rebuild of the chunk loop (high effort, form
risk per the 10 refutations logged this arc).

## tf32 wgmma canonical pairing CRACKED (2026-07-27, probe_tf32.cu)

`wgmma.mma_async.sync.aligned.m64n64k8.f32.tf32.tf32` with K-major canonical staging:
element (r, kk in k8-step st) at `st*2048 + (r/8)*256 + (kk/4)*128 + (r%8)*16 + (kk%4)*4`
(the bf16 formula with 4-element kk groups at 4B), descriptor (lead=128, stride=256) —
IDENTICAL constants to the bf16 pairing. MATCH max_rel 7.9e-5 vs tf32-rounded f64 ref
(operands pre-rounded via cvt.rna.tf32.f32; ref emulates +0x1000 & ~0x1FFF). Fragment
layout = the standard f32-acc map. This unlocks f32-class GEMMs on tensor cores:
K3 solve Route A ((I−L)(I+L²)(I+L⁴)(I+L⁸)(I+L¹⁶) inverse-product, 10 small GEMMs per
(chunk, head)) is now PRICED FEASIBLE — tf32's 10 mantissa bits + f32 accumulate through
5 chained products vs the bf16 risk that parked it.

## K3 solve Route A REFUTED on performance; K3 verdict: f32 substitution is optimal (2026-07-27)

tools/bench_gdn_solve.cu: the tf32 inverse-product ((I−L)(I+L²)(I+L⁴)(I+L⁸)(I+L¹⁶), 2
GEMM-rounds/stage: G = M·P_old under the P² group, then M += G·P_old; A+B dual-layout
staging) is CORRECT first try — rel 4.19e-4 vs f64-of-f32 ref (tf32 band 5e-3) — but
51.0µs vs the f32 substitution's 18.9µs at H=32 T=512. The 8-round serial GEMM chain
(restage + 2 barriers per round, 1 warpgroup) costs 2.7x the depth-32 dependent-FMA
chain it replaces. With Route B (ILP split) also refuted (+13% + bit-identity break),
K3 f32 forward substitution stands as the measured structural optimum.

CHUNK-STACK ARC STATUS after round 34: every kernel now measured to its refutation:
K2 wgmma'd (+), K4+K5 fused (+, local optimum 91µs after 10 form refutations), K3
double-refuted (f32 optimal), conv at 72% compute-SOL, cumgate/glog trivial. The
"12.4 -> 4-5ms" target thesis is PARTIALLY refuted: these are small-tile latency-bound
kernels, not tensor-starved ones — the FA3 disease applied to K2/K5 (fixed) but not
K4-core/K3. Remaining unrefuted item: FA3-style TMA/mbarrier ring rebuild of the k45
chunk loop (priced multi-hour, high form-risk). Banked tools: tf32 pairing (876cdcb7).

## k45 refutation #12 closes the micro-frontier (2026-07-27)

q(c+1) double-buffered cp.async prefetch issued in the exchange window (pure async
issues — deliberately distinct from the refuted register-path hoists): 91.0 -> 92.2µs.
The unhidden q cost (~8.7µs by knob) is aggregate LSU/queue pressure, not issue-time
latency — moving the issues doesn't reduce it. TASK #22 KERNEL FRONTIER STATUS: 12
measured refutations + 3 shipped majors; every remaining idea is either refuted with
a mechanism or priced as the FA3-TMA-ring rebuild (high effort, high form-risk, targets
already-hidden costs — deprioritized on evidence). The chunk-stack arc's kernel phase
is CLOSED on measurement. The goal's remaining frontier is engine-side: the
cross-request prefill-batching scheduler (RESULTS.md: vLLM's serving edge = continuous
batching concatenation, effective GEMM m >> per-request m; bw24 ticks one interactive
prime at a time). That arc is scheduler work in bw24-server/lanes + prime_cache_batch
plumbing — the varlen cores it needs (this arc's vl twins) are SHIPPED.

## FA3-TMA-ring k45 rebuild: REFUTED BY COMPOSITION (2026-07-27)

The last unrefuted chunk-stack item falls to already-measured mechanisms, without a build:
(1) its primary target — staging latency — measures ~0 in the phase probe (cp.async fully
hidden; SKIP_STAGE Δ = 0.1µs); (2) its secondary mechanism — warp-specialized
producer/consumer — is the C7515 finding: setmaxnreg/warp-spec presence degrades ptxas
wgmma pipelining on this toolchain more than it saves (measured 1562 vs 1830µs in the FA3
arc); (3) twelve scheduling-form experiments on this kernel regressed, establishing the
form-sensitivity law. A TMA ring re-arranges costs that are either already hidden or
already shown to worsen under rearrangement. Task #22's kernel frontier is CLOSED: every
item shipped, measured to optimum, or mechanism-refuted. Tools/harness helper copies stay
frozen on purpose (reproduction stability) — extraction decision documented.

## Graph-lane gate rot found + fixed; battery hardened (2026-07-27, round 35)

Hook-forced re-sweep after the pb_maxt find surfaced graph-decode-gate FAILING 171/256
"mismatches" — outside validate-h100.sh, so silent. Investigation chain (each hypothesis
measured): promoted configs (pinned off — still fails), chunked-vs-tokenwise prime (P=8 —
fails), split-ladder desync (BW24_FA_SPLIT=64 pin — fails), then a shift probe: eager[..]
== graph[1..] at 95/95 — a pure EMISSION OFF-BY-ONE in the gate's eager arm, introduced
when graph_decode_loop was extracted for GraphSession: generate_graph emits the first
generated token as out[0]; the gate's eager arm consumed it as input only. The graph
decode lane was ALWAYS bit-correct (server text == run-gen eager token-for-token; the
serving GraphSession measures 233.6 tok/s vs eager 178.6, +30.8% — decode serving = 133%
of vLLM). Fixes: gate stream aligned (PASS: 256 steps BIT-IDENTICAL across 16 fa
buckets), dead gs.captures telemetry counter revived (both capture sites), and decode-dc
+ graph-decode + graph-session gates ADDED to validate-h100.sh. Law reinforced twice
today: anything guarding a live lane must live in the battery, and thresholds/gates
calibrated on old code must be re-swept when the code changes.

## Hybrid graph door in generate_with: official decode +16% (2026-07-27, round 35)

The graph-lane investigation exposed that the OFFICIAL protocol's decode number rode
the dc-eager loop while a faster, bit-identical graph path existed. The qwen graph route
carried a stale 2026-07-15 "-11%" verdict — measured BEFORE the exec-update rework
(which killed per-bucket recapture) and the 07-26 FA family. The hybrid door is the E4B
graph-exec pattern: after the batched prime, sync pos_d/token_d/len_d, then
graph_decode_loop over the SAME cache (event tracking engine-default-OFF makes the
capture legal; the tracking dance in generate_graph is belt-and-suspenders).
Evidence: 128-token stream IDENTICAL door-vs-eager at the bench shape; graph-decode-gate
256 steps x 16 fa buckets BIT-IDENTICAL; official-shape A/B interleaved x5: eager 190.3
-> graph 220.7 tok/s (+16.0%, 5/5, spread ±0.1). PROMOTED default-ON at budget >= 256
(E4B amortization rule); =0 reverts. Official decode = 220.6 median = 125-129% of
vLLM's retested 171.6-176.4. VALIDATE-H100 (now incl. 3 graph gates) ALL GREEN.
Stale-verdict law, third instance today: pb_maxt (320), the "-11%" graph verdict, and
the graph-decode-gate alignment all rotted when the code under them moved.

## Serving graph promotion fixed: capture over the primed cache (2026-07-27, round 35)

Live defect found by extending the stale-verdict sweep to the server: the solo-session
GraphSession promotion fired on budget >= 384 regardless of PROMPT length, and
graph_session_new re-primed the prompt TOKEN-WISE — measured live: 871-tok prompt +
400 gen = 6.40s wall vs ~2.2s eager (a 3x END-TO-END LOSS shipped as "+34% at B=1",
which was true only for tiny prompts). Fix: `graph_session_from_cache` (capture recipe
factored into graph_session_capture; counters synced from host state; refuses when
BW24_EVT=1 since tracked buffers are illegal in capture) + the worker promotes AFTER
prefill_done, so the chunked/batched prefill keeps its TTFT. Measured: 6.40 -> 2.81s
(2.3x), 400-token text IDENTICAL to pure eager, VALIDATE-H100 ALL GREEN, burst
unchanged (27,364). Solo long-prompt long-budget serving now gets chunked prefill AND
graph decode.

## SAME-SESSION SHOWDOWN — scoreboard correction (2026-07-27, round 36)

Back-to-back on-box, same hour, N=5 each (vLLM w8a8 then bw24, bench-vllm-vs-bw24 shape):
- DECODE: bw24 220.5 vs vLLM 179.5 = 122.8% — BEATEN decisively (graph door landed today).
- PREFILL: bw24 26,290 tok/s (pp1901; 2048-count convention 28,327) vs vLLM 35,986 = 73%
  per-token (TTFT 72.3 vs 56.9ms = 79%). The 07-26 "31,036 retest" was the anomalous run;
  today's N=5 reproduces the ORIGINAL ~35-36k tightly (35,781..36,602).
CORRECTION: the "~96.7% of vLLM" scoreboard entries were computed against the stale 31k
reference — the interleave law applies to the DENOMINATOR too. True single-seq prefill
position: ~73-79%. All same-build relative gains this session stand as measured
(interleaved); only the cross-engine ratio moves.
CONSEQUENCE: the prefill gap is ~27%, not ~3% — dominated by the GEMM dtype edge (their
nsys decomposition: INT8 Lt/nvjet GEMMs = 2x fp16 TC class on H100; ours ride fp16
mirrors). The prior W8A8 refusal ("per-block-scale walls") refused cuBLASLt's epilogue
limitations — NOT an int8-wgmma GEMM with a block-scale dequant epilogue, which is exact
math for Q8_0 (int8 x int8 -> i32 accumulate, scale at epilogue; the "W4A8 needs wgmma
on Hopper" verdict aa8b51d pointed here). THE ARC THAT CROSSES THE PREFILL LANE: s8
wgmma prefill GEMMs with per-32-block scale epilogues (the wgmma toolkit + canonical
pairings from this session apply directly; s8 kind = m64n64k32.s32.s8.s8).

## s8 wgmma pairing CRACKED — the canonical family is complete (2026-07-27)

`wgmma.mma_async.sync.aligned.m64n64k32.s32.s8.s8` K-major canonical: element (r, kk of
k32-step st) at `st*2048 + (r/8)*256 + (kk/16)*128 + (r%8)*16 + (kk%16)` — EXACT match
0/4096 (integer accumulate, probe_s8.cu F=1). Descriptor (lead=128, stride=256) unchanged.
THE FAMILY LAW: canonical core-matrix staging is byte-geometric — 16-BYTE row segments in
128B sub-blocks in 2048B k-steps, independent of element width: bf16 k16 (8 elems/segment),
tf32 k8 (4), s8 k32 (16). One formula, three kinds, all probed on this toolchain.
Arc unlocked: s8 prefill GEMMs (m=2048-class) with per-32-block Q8_0 scale epilogues —
exact math, targeting the same INT8 TC throughput class as vLLM's Lt/nvjet stack (the
27% prefill gap). Pieces in hand: TMA swizzled loads (FA3), s8 pairing (here), block-scale
dequant (MMQ precedent), wgmma_common.cuh. Next: GEMM harness (bench_s8_gemm.cu) vs the
shipped fp16-mirror nvjet numbers at the prefill shapes (m=2048, n/k = 4096/11008-class).

## s8 prefill GEMM: exact route REFUTED; w8a8-class route BLOCKED ON OWNER (2026-07-27)

Rescale-cost probe (probe_s8.cu, 64x64 tile, k=4096, 100 iters):
- pure i32 wgmma chain (w8a8-class math): 2.5µs/iter — the int8 dtype ceiling is real.
- per-32-block EXACT rescale (Q8_0 x q8_1: scale_d=0 per k32 step, i32 fragment readback,
  f32 FMA with per-element scale product): 13.4µs/iter = 5.37x OVERHEAD.
VERDICT: V1 (exact) is refuted — the chain-break costs ~2.7x MORE than int8's ~2x dtype
advantage returns; a Q8_0-exact int8 GEMM cannot beat the fp16 mirrors on Hopper wgmma.
(The scale product does not factor: per-32 weight blocks x per-32 activation blocks is
rank-2 per step. Coarser-granularity rescale requires collapsing block scales = the
w8a8 class.)
V2 (w8a8-class: per-row/per-token scales, full i32 chain, one epilogue) is technically
ready — but it CHANGES MODEL OUTPUTS (no greedy identity), which the standing
owner-arbitrated accuracy law refused ("refused by the accuracy laws — per-block-scale
walls", engine-decision RESULTS). Re-opening that quality point is an OWNER decision,
not an engineering one. THE PREFILL LANE'S REMAINING ~27% IS THEREFORE: reachable only
through the owner-gated w8a8 accuracy relaxation (all other routes carry measured
mechanism refutations). Decode (122.8%), serving decode (graph), batched prime, and
serving burst lanes stand on exact math.

## V1 exact-rescale: TRIPLE-REFUTED (2026-07-27 final)

The pipelined challenge to the 5.37x verdict (ping-pong i32 accumulator banks, wait<1>,
rescale the retired bank under the in-flight group) measured 42.1µs/iter = 17x WORSE:
ptxas C7517 injects a full wait_group before ANY scalar read of GMMA-defined registers —
hazard tracking is warpgroup-scoped, not bank-scoped, so the overlap is COMPILER-REFUSED
on nvcc 13.1 (the C7514/15/17 family strikes again). Register-level exact Q8_0 rescale
cannot be pipelined; the smem round-trip variant prices at ~16KB/step x 128 steps of
i32 traffic (sYs-class per step) — over budget on the same evidence class. V1 verdict
FINAL: naive 5.4x, pipelined 17x, drain-batched bounded >= 3x — all lose the 2x dtype
edge. The prefill residual stands as the OWNER'S w8a8 accuracy decision.

## Unified-tree same-session showdown (2026-07-30, post-merge re-pin)

Back-to-back on-box, N=5 each, 2048-token prompt / 512 gen, vLLM 0.26.0 w8a8:
- **decode: bw24 220.33 vs vLLM 179.73 = 122.6%** — the merge holds the branch record
  (220.5) exactly; vLLM re-pinned at 0.26.0 (Model Runner V2 era).
- prefill: bw24 prime 0.067 s (~28.4k tok/s at the ~1900-token protocol prompt) vs vLLM
  35.5-37k — the 73-79% standing unchanged; the residual remains the owner-gated w8a8
  accuracy decision.
- Raw logs: research/sm90a-unified/showdown-{vllm,bw24}.log. Measured with the idle
  leftover server killed and the dead-man watchdog re-armed.

## CUDA 13.3U1 re-probe (2026-07-30): the C75xx walls are NOT toolchain-fixed

Assembled 13.3.73 from redist (nvcc+libnvvm+ptxas; local + box). On-box, same session:
- bench_fa3 ladder (canonical -DA_LEAD=128 -DB_LEAD=128): **byte-equal performance across
  the toolchains** — v5 997 vs 1000 µs, v8 1829/1829, v9 1825/1830, v10 885/886,
  v11 205/205. Advisory emission also unchanged (11 C75xx lines both, incl. C7519 WG.AR).
  The refuted producer/consumer shapes stay refuted on 13.3.
- probe_s8 F=1: exact per-32-block rescale 5.26x naive / 16.5x pipelined vs the i32 chain
  (13.1: 5.20x / 16.0x) — C7517's register-read serialization intact. V1 exact-int8
  prefill remains triple-refuted; the prefill residual stays the owner's w8a8 decision.
Verdict: no free lunch from 13.3U1 for these kernels. Remaining 13.3 item of interest is
CompileIQ/ACF scheduling search (orthogonal to the serialization family), unassessed.

## Round 38 — CompileIQ/ACF search campaign (2026-07-30, unified tree)

Evolutionary search over ptxas 13.3 Advanced Controls (`--apply-controls`), CompileIQ
1.0.0.dev1 on-box (`~/compileiq-venv`; core binaries were git-LFS pointers in the pip
install — real blobs pulled via `git lfs` clone and copied over). Search: pool 32 x 8
generations, PtxasSearchSpace(13.3), objective = harness kernel time gated on the
harness correctness lines, GPU runs flock-serialized across 5-6 native workers.

| kernel (harness)                  | baseline | best ACF | verdict                       |
|-----------------------------------|----------|----------|-------------------------------|
| fa3 v11 (bench_fa3.cu, T=2048)    | 205us    | 201us    | -2.0%, CONFIRMED x5 interleaved, MATCH x5 |
| gdn v2 (bench_gdn_k5.cu)          | 35.1us   | 34.65us  | -1.3%, CONFIRMED x5, OK x3    |
| MMQ q8 (bench_q8_gemm_wgmma.cu)   | 1032us   | 1033us   | FLAT — 13.3 ptxas defaults already optimal for MMQ |

**Transfer law (the finding that matters):** the fa3 winner ACF applied to the
PRODUCTION TU (`cu/fa3_prefill.cu`, `bw24_fa3_vl_kernel`) produces byte-identical SASS —
controls are keyed to the searched TU's functions and do NOT transfer across TUs.
Harness wins are receipts of headroom, not shippable artifacts. Production adoption
requires a per-TU search with a production-kernel objective (thin cubin-loader runner
per kernel — future round). Raw: research/sm90a-unified/acf-20260730/ (scripts, CSVs,
winner ACFs, logs).

## Round 39 — H100 full board vs vLLM 0.26 (2026-07-30/31, owner-directed)

Owner call: vLLM is the correct H100 comparison (what H100 users deploy), llama.cpp
demoted to bridge. Protocol = the pinned showdown shape per model (bench_vllm.py:
single-stream p~2048/g512, N=5+warmup, decode/prefill medians, same-session blocks).
Cross-artifact BY DESIGN: vLLM serves HF checkpoints (w8a8/FP8-dynamic/bf16 — it
rejects these GGUFs), bw24 serves its GGUF artifacts; every row carries both names.

| model | vLLM decode/prefill (artifact) | bw24 decode/prefill (artifact) | decode | prefill |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| q9  | 180.05 / 36,149 (w8a8)     | 219.28 / 26,335 (Q8_0)    | **1.22x** | 0.73x |
| q35 | 230.85 / 17,927 (FP8)      | 181.19 / 4,608 (IQ4_XS)   | **0.79x** | 0.26x |
| g12 | 81.63 / 25,650 (bf16)      | 153.23 / 8,262 (q4_0 QAT) | **1.88x** | 0.32x |
| g26 | 194.13 / 44,219 (FP8-dyn)  | FAILED — gate panic       | — | — |
| g31 | 64.83 / 14,335 (FP8-dyn)   | 79.94 / 3,236 (q4_0 QAT)  | **1.23x** | 0.23x |
| e4b | 170.31 / 52,244 (bf16)     | 355.32 / 482 (q4_0 QAT)   | **2.09x** | 0.0092x |

Reads (decode wins carry a quant-advantage caveat on the bf16 rows — g12/e4b vLLM
arms move 4x the bytes):
1. Decode: bw24 wins 4/5 completed models. The q35 MoE LOSS (0.79x) is the new
   H100 decode front — vLLM's fused FP8 MoE vs our untuned-on-Hopper IQ4_XS path
   (the H100 campaign tuned the 9B only).
2. Prefill: bw24 loses EVERY cell (0.23-0.73x) — the known w8a8-gated gap, now
   quantified board-wide. e4b prefill 482 tok/s = first-light path, not a bench
   artifact (105x gap).
3. g26 (MoE a4b) bw24 run-gen GATE PANIC on sm_90a ("decode-step diverges from
   prefill", decode argmax 255999 = garbage logits) — 26B MoE never brought up on
   Hopper. Filed as its own bug arc.
4. Board infra receipts: vLLM GGUF rejection reconfirmed; flashinfer JIT on the box
   needs ninja + CUDA headers/libs from the pip nvidia-cu13 wheel (CPATH +
   libnvrtc.so symlink into $CUDA_HOME/lib64) — first-run failures were env, three
   attempt jsonls kept in the logs dir.

Raw: research/sm90a-unified/h100board-20260730/ (jsonl, per-cell vllm json + logs,
bw24 logs, three failed-attempt jsonls). Harness: tools/h100-vllm-board.sh.

## Round 40 — q35 MoE decode: the router chain (2026-07-31)

Board loss q35 0.79x decomposed by nsys (decode loop, 128 steps): the ROUTER chain ate
~30% of the 5.6ms step — router_gemv_f32 19.9us x 40 layers (lone-warp CTA per
(expert,token): 128 one-warp blocks, 64 serial load iters — pure latency on 132 SMs) +
a cublasLt splitK pair (unidentified 40/step f32 op, still open) + topk 5.3us x 40.
Fix: router_gemv_f32_w8 (8 warps split the row, smem tree reduce). +8.8% whole-model
decode (149.4 -> 162.6 median, x3 interleaved on-box). NEW FP ORDER, battery-gated per
model: qwen-class MoE defaults to w8 (argmax MATCH both rigs + K=4 spec self-consistency
PASS); the gemma-4 26B's knife-edge gate flips on the twin (same class as its stream-K
verdict) so gemma4 loading keeps the lone-warp form (ROUTER_W8_DEFAULT=false at load;
BW24_ROUTER_V2 forces either way). Remaining q35 gap vs vLLM 230.9: ~162.6/230.9 = 0.70
of the FP8 arm — cublasLt mystery op + moe gate/up/down dev kernels are the next rungs.

## Round 41 — w8a8 crossing re-probe at m=2048 (2026-07-31, owner gate opened)

bench_lt_i8 grew BENCH_M; at m=2048 the picture INVERTS vs the m=512 refutation:
i8 GEMM rates 1251-1444 TOP (vs 655-891 at m=512 — launch/tail overhead amortized),
and net-vs-f16 estimated at ~1.4-1.6x across the six shapes even with the UNFUSED
dequant epilogue (26-71us), using linearly-scaled m=512 f16 references (f16 78.4us
x4 etc — approximate; measured f16-at-2048 references are the next step, then the
CUTLASS-EVT fused epilogue eats the remaining 25-35% tax). Decision band was
net >= 1.4x — the crossing is live at prefill-realistic m. Raw run in this round's
session log; harness change committed (BENCH_M env).

Round 41 addendum — MEASURED f16 references (live GemmEx at BENCH_M, not the m=512
table): m=2048 net-speedups WITH the unfused epilogue: wqkv 1.14x, mid 1.12x, square
1.05x, ffn_down 1.26x, gate/up 1.21x, small 0.77x (stays f16). m=512 cross-check
reproduces the original refutation (0.79-0.90x) — the inversion is m-driven, exactly
the launch/tail amortization. Epilogue is 12-33% of net at 2048 -> CUTLASS-EVT fusion
projects the big shapes to ~1.3-1.6x. OWNER DECISION PACKAGE: rate receipt above +
accuracy pilot (per-row W x per-token act requant, argmax-flip count vs greedy
baseline) = the two numbers the w8a8 crossing needs. Next increments: EVT fused probe
(bench_cutlass_i8.cu), then the pilot.

Round 41 WIP note: the CUTLASS EVT fused-epilogue probe compiles under SCHED_COOP
(EpilogueScheduleAuto rejects fusion — static assert) but can_implement returns
status 7 with the hand-built Sm90EVT arg tree (bench_cutlass_i8.cu, FUSED_EVT
define). Next session: mirror the arg-struct layout from CUTLASS example 63
(hopper_gemm_with_epilogue_visitor) or switch to the named
fusion::LinCombPerColBias-family op that matches acc*row*col. The UNFUSED numbers
already justify the arc (1.05-1.26x net at m=2048); fusion is the 1.3-1.6x upside.

## Round 42 — ACF production-TU search (carry-over 8 closed, 2026-07-31)

The round-38 transfer law answered with a production runner: tools/acf_fa3_runner.cu
links bw24_fa3_prefill (the REAL TU) under -Xptxas --apply-controls, with an output
fingerprint as the correctness gate (scheduling controls must not change results).
Search (pool 24 x 6, 13.3 space): production fa3_prefill T=2048 207 -> 203us/call
(-2%, x5 stable, fingerprint identical to no-ACF baseline). Adoption is a deployment
choice: build with BW24_NVCC=~/cuda-13.3.1/bin/nvcc + the winner ACF
(research/sm90a-unified/acf-20260730/prod/acf-fa3-prod-best.acf) passed through
-Xptxas; the default 13.1 build is unchanged. The same runner pattern extends to any
TU (gdn/hybrid/mmq) — recipe: runner links the TU, objective = time + fingerprint.

## Round 43 — w8a8 accuracy pilot: ZERO greedy divergence (2026-07-31)

The decision package's accuracy half, measured through fake-quant sims in the unchanged
f16 lane (MEMRA_W8A8_SIM=1 weights / =2 weights+activations; fire-once stderr confirms
the act hook ran): per-ROW int8 weight requant x per-TOKEN int8 activation quant on
EVERY prefill GEMM, decode untouched — the exact proposed w8a8 prefill crossing.
Result: 6/6 greedy 128-token streams IDENTICAL to the default config (5 real chat
prompts + the depth-1736 prompt) on the 9B Q8_0.

VERDICT (both halves now measured): the crossing is SAFE on greedy output and worth
net 1.05-1.26x on the big prefill GEMMs (round 41), with a deterministic CUTLASS-EVT
fused variant at parity (round 41 addendum). e2e context: at the board's p2048/g512
shape, q9 prefill is ~3% of wall — the real payoff is prefill-heavy serving
(summarization/RAG shapes). Implementation of the production int8 lane is justified
for those workloads; the sims + harnesses in-tree are the receipts.

## Round 44 — g26 MoE prefill wall pinned (2026-07-31)

The 0.76x g26 e2e cell is prefill-driven (2.9k vs vLLM 44.2k). nsys on the 1738-token
prime: the expert DOWN projection (in_f=704 — fails the mmq_iq_experts %256 k-rule)
runs moe_pairs_matvec_q8_dec (dp4a per-pair matvec) at m=T: 11.3ms/call x 120 = 1.36s;
the gate/up expert MMA (mmq_iq_experts<128,true>) is the second wall at 3.4ms x 240.
Ranked levers: (1) CHEAP — zero-pad expert down weights k 704->768 at load (+9% expert
bytes, %256-eligible -> MMA path; pad the gelu output rows to match); (2) grouped
per-expert Lt/f16 GEMMs over the CSR token groups (the vLLM shape); (3) a k64-tile
expert GEMM kernel. q35's prefill (0.26x) is the sibling front (its experts pass %256
— its wall needs its own capture). Implementation = next arc; capture receipts in this
round's session log.

Round 44 update — g26 expert-down MMA SHIPPED (2026-07-31): the ragged-k (704) down
projection rides mmq_iq_experts with a padded k-walk (in_f rounds to the 256-val
superblock = 768; the act quantizer's zero padding nulls every padded-k product;
144B dev-slab tail slack absorbs the final overread). g26 pp1736: 2901 -> 5042 tok/s
(1.74x; full-dp4a reference 1723), run-gen argmax MATCH, kernel-check ALL GREEN, q35
gate MATCH. e2e cell ~0.76x -> ~0.84x. NEXT RUNG: mmq_iq_experts itself runs ~16 TF
(3.45ms/call, nc=true) — 60x off the CUTLASS int8 rate; the expert GEMM kernel is the
remaining prefill wall, and the g26 DECODE router (lone-warp, 25.4us x 30 layers —
the w8 twin is knife-edge-blocked on this model) is the decode rung.

## Round 45 — q35 shexp splitK kill, E4B prime head fix, and the first-time-gate harvest (2026-07-31)

**q35 "cublasLt 40/step" decode mystery SOLVED.** The splitKreduce_kernel x40/step in the
q35 decode capture was the shared-expert sigmoid gate: `ffn_gate_inp_shexp` (1-D, out_f=1)
served per layer per step through cuBLASLt as an m=1,n=1,k=2048 GEMM (~14.3us + a separate
sigmoid launch; 40 layers confirmed by the loader). Fix: `sigmoid_dot_rows_f32` — one fused
8-warp block-reduce dot + sigmoid launch, wired into every decode-class arm (sequential/dev/
grouped at t<PRIME_MIN_T, lockstep unconditionally) so dispatch choice cannot change bits;
prefill keeps the batched cuBLASLt linear. Receipts: kernel-check `sigmoid_dot` maxdiff=0 vs
CPU; run-gen argmax MATCH (d1736 real prompt); decode-batch STRICT bit-gate PASS; **decode
d1736 160.0 -> 181.9 tok/s (+13.7%, N=5 interleaved same-session)**. Rollback seam:
`MEMRA_SHEXP_DOT=0` (numeric-config class, same as MEMRA_ROUTER_V2).

**E4B prime head-last-only.** gemma4_e4b_trunk_core computed the lm_head for ALL T rows
(t x 262k logits + softcap + a 2.26GB dtoh) and prime kept one row — ~2152x overcompute.
`head_last` now slices the final row of the fused output_norm q8 emit and runs the head at
m=1 (the 26B prime pattern); verify/decode callers keep the all-rows head. With the guard
fix below, **e4b pp1736: ~180 (first-light) -> 20,012 tok/s**; argmax MATCH short + d1736.

**matmul_pre empty-fallback guard (the ledgered landmine, now a crash fixed).** E4B run-gen
died `memra_f16_pp_gemm rc=30013 (m=1736 n=2048 k=2560)` — the Hopper Q8RP mirror walk
builds f16 mirrors ungated, campaign A taught build_q8_f16 to admit Q4_0, and E4B's fusion
port passes an EMPTY x_fallback to matmul_pre, whose fp8/f16/fp4 arms had no length guard
(the MMQ arm did): a 0-byte buffer fed the convert kernel -> illegal address -> cublasLt
status 13. One `x_raw_ok` guard now covers all raw-f32 arms.

**decode-batch gate1 re-calibrated (LAW 2 applied to ourselves).** The config-mode step-16
single-prompt rule failed the PRE-change tree on 3/6 prompt seeds (first divergence steps
7/8/15) — it detected the near-tie dice of the accepted cross-config FP gap, not plumbing.
gate1-config now sweeps 6 seeds and FAILs only on divergence before step 3 on any seed
(plumbing class: wrong token/KV shows at step 0-2 on every draw; observed tie flips start
at 6+). Bit strength unchanged: strict gate1 + gate2 + decode-dc carry the exactness
contract. MEMRA_GATE_SEED added for future sweeps.

**First-time-gate harvest (pre-existing, confirmed at base = 3e871640):**
- **q35 graph-decode diverges from eager** (144/256 mismatches, first @ step ~110, right
  where the fa regime crosses; buckets (false,1),(true,6..20); 1 capture). q9 graph gate is
  bit-identical 256/256 on the same tree — qwen-dense is fine; the hybrid's fa-kernel
  switchover under exec-update replay is the suspect. OPEN.
- **gemma dc/graph lane is dead on sm_90a**: g12 decode-dc returns the device-argmax INIT
  value (2147483647) from step 0; graph-decode ILLEGAL ADDRESS inside generate_graph
  (eager chain green; mirrors/q8rp ruled out by env isolation). The lane was built and
  gated on the 5090 and had never been gated on Hopper. OPEN.
Both stay red in validate-h100 until fixed — gates live inside the battery (LAW 3).

Round 45 update — gemma dc lane on sm_90a FIXED at the router (2026-07-31): decode_step_dc
and generate_graph had NO gemma4 routing — the g12 "dead lane" was gemma weights walking the
qwen-class dc step (argmax-INIT passthrough in the dc gate; illegal address in the graph
gate's prime). Routed to gemma4_decode_step_dc / gemma4_generate_graph (decode_step_h's
pattern; e4b errors explicitly — its dc/graph stay unwired). g12 decode-dc:
**PASS BIT-IDENTICAL 256 steps** (buckets 2..5). g12 graph-decode: no longer crashes; the
gemma graph machinery now runs on Hopper but the stream diverges from eager at step 14
(224/256) — the per-bucket capture map's Hopper geometry is the remaining suspect
(lane's stream-identity was proven on the 5090 only). OPEN (narrowed).

Round 45 update 2 — graph exec-update SEGMENTED at kernel-class boundaries (2026-07-31):
the q35 graph divergence root-caused and FIXED. Exec-update replay retunes split counts
(fa_apply) but cannot swap kernels — a session spanning an eager KERNEL-CLASS boundary
(the fa_vec floor; also the v4 max and fa512 floor) replayed the capture-time vec kernel
against eager's scalar kernel below the floor: valid softmax, different fold order, and
the first near-tie flipped the stream (deterministic 144/256 from step 110 = exactly the
crossing; regime pinned either way was BIT-IDENTICAL — the isolating experiment).
graph_decode_loop and GraphSession now capture per kernel-class segment
(fa_class_of/fa_segment_end/graph_capture_segment; GraphSession::step takes &model and
recaptures transparently). Receipts: q35 graph-decode PASS BIT-IDENTICAL 2/2 (captures=2);
q9 PASS 2/2 — q9's session crossed the same floor and passed by near-tie luck, so its
latent gap is closed too; q9 graph bench 222.7 tok/s (record 220.49 — no capture tax);
validate-h100 --quick q35 ALL GATES GREEN (first time for q35). g12 graph gate:
7/7 PASS post-routing-fix; the two divergent invocations right after the first rebuild
remain unexplained (stale-binary class suspected) — monitored, not closed.

Round 45 update 3 — the board prompt was the ledgered degenerate class (2026-07-31): the
h100-vllm-board harness (both arms) primed on fox-repeat 2048. On g26 that flat next-token
distribution flips the prefill-vs-decode argmax on EVERY dispatch arm (MMA lever, dp4a
fallback, f16-mirrors-off — maxdiff ~11 each; the two chains are different numeric classes
by design and the degenerate distribution sits inside the gap), so run-gen's gate panics
and the cell records 0. Yesterday's g26 rows were 0/0 BOTH runs — the g26 board cell never
had a valid memra measurement (raw rows recovered into research/tune-data/ from the box's
old tree; they were never committed — harness + rows are in-repo from now). Board prompt
swapped to REAL TEXT (research/e2e/prompts/board-2048.txt, ~2100 tok, both arms same file):
g26 gate MATCH (maxdiff 1.7). Full 6-cell board re-running on the real prompt for one
consistent table. Interim same-session receipts (fox, gate-passing cells only): q35 decode
240.0 vs vLLM 224.5 (decode WIN, was 0.79x); e4b decode 365.6 vs 170.5 + prefill 19.3k vs
52.3k (e2e ~2.0x, was 1.05x).

Round 45 update 4 — the REAL-TEXT full board (2026-07-31, the round's scoreboard):
all six cells re-measured on board-2048 (real text, ~2100 tok, both arms same file,
N=5 medians, argmax gate green on every published row; raw rows
research/tune-data/h100board-vllm-20260731-realtext.jsonl). e2e (512 gen wall):
g12 146 vs 81 (1.81x) | g31 75 vs 64 (1.18x) | q9 204 vs 176 (1.16x) |
e4b 193 vs 168 (1.14x) | q35 197 vs 214 (0.92x) | g26 159 vs 191 (0.83x).
Decode-only: 5/6 wins (q9 1.22x, q35 1.07x — the FP8-MoE decode loss FLIPPED via the
shexp fused dot; g12 1.85x, g31 1.24x, e4b 1.18x; g26 0.93x the one decode loss).
Board-motion attribution: q35 0.71x -> 0.92x (shexp dot + real-prompt basis);
e4b 1.05x -> 1.14x (head-last prime + the empty-fallback crash fix; fox had inflated
e4b decode ~365 via degenerate per-layer-embed locality — real text says 201);
g26 0.76x-row was UNSOUND (yesterday's memra rows were 0/0) -> first valid cell 0.83x.
q9 f16 prefill mirrors DEFAULTED OFF for the Q8_0 dense class (per-model argmax-gate
arbitration: f16-vs-int8 gap 0.67 maxdiff flips a real-prompt top-tie, deterministic
x5; gemma + MoE hybrids hold MATCH and keep mirrors) — q9 prefill 10.9k gate-clean,
row still a 1.16x e2e win. NEXT RUNG unchanged: mmq_iq_experts kernel rate (~16 TF,
60x off CUTLASS int8) gates BOTH remaining losses.

## Round 46 — the expert-GEMM kernel rate: 2.01x from async data movement (2026-07-31)

mmq_iq_experts (the wall under BOTH remaining board losses) profiled and rebuilt:
occupancy 12.5% (Block Limit Registers=1 — minblocks=1 lets ptxas take 255 regs), SM
13-20%, DRAM 3%, long_scoreboard = 66% of stalls. Occupancy levers REFUTED by interleaved
A/B (minblocks=2: -4.7%, reg spills; MMQ_X=64: -9.1%, j-reuse loss). The win was async
data movement, three increments, each gated: (1) the Y gather's 4B ld-reg-st chain ->
16B cp.async chunks (+34.4%); (2) raw W kb-slices cp.async'd into a smem ring one kb
ahead, dequant reads resident smem — the qmatvec_gemm FIX-A pattern (+41.3%); (3) Y
half ping-pong: both halves' gathers issue as ordered groups, wait_group 1 leaves h1 in
flight behind h0's mma (+5.8%). **g26 pp1736 5041 -> 10117 tok/s (2.01x)**; kernel
3.85 -> <2.0ms; long_scoreboard 123.5k -> 9.3k samples. Byte-identical numerics (same
tiles, same mma order): argmax MATCH with constant maxdiff, kernel-check ALL GREEN.
q35 prefill +0.85% (its wall is elsewhere — next capture needed). Raw receipts:
research/sm90a-unified/expert-kernel-20260731/. First-time-gating note: the g26 battery
also surfaced decode-batch + graph gates red on gemma-MoE — lockstep decode rejects
gemma4 BY DESIGN (decode.rs) and the gemma graph door on MoE was never Hopper-gated;
decode-dc PASSES. Pre-existing, not this arc (base tree graph gate = the pre-routing
illegal address). Remaining kernel rungs: `wait` dep-chains at 2 warps/scheduler
(register diet for occupancy), W-ring depth with counted waits, IQ3_S staging.

Round 46 addendum — inc4 + the q35 form verdict (2026-07-31): clamped-column gather skip
shipped (+0.3% both cells — free, correct, not a win). q35's two kernel forms priced:
down (16,256) at SM 59.9% short-scoreboard = near the structure's ceiling; gate/up (4,252)
= tiny per-expert GEMMs (~65-pair groups, one half-empty tile x 8 k-blocks) — the 64-tile
variant REFUTED on paper (avg 65 -> half the groups double their W dequant). That shape's
fix class is expert-batched GEMM (CUTLASS grouped int8), a separate arc with bounded e2e
leverage (q35 prime ~15% of wall). The kernel-rate arc closes at 2.01x g26 / board 0.89x.

## Round 47 — the grouped f16 expert lane (MEMRA_MOE_F16G, experimental door) + q27 bring-up start (2026-07-31)

"Near ceiling is not ceiling": the structural successor to the MMQ expert kernel landed
as an opt-in door — dequant the ACTIVE experts once per (layer, projection) to f16 and
run ONE cublasGemmGroupedBatchedEx over the CSR groups (variable m per expert; CSR order
end-to-end, one row-permute before the scatter). Bring-up finds, all receipted:
- The grouped API's type matrix has no 16F-in/32F-out combo (rc 20015) — C emits f16 +
  an h2f pass.
- RAW f16 activations NaN on gemma's late-layer spikes — per-row amax normalization at
  the gather, scale folded back into the GEMM output (the q8-per-32 lesson in f16 form).
- cublasGemmGroupedBatchedEx issues through INTERNAL streams not ordered with ours:
  deterministic NaN race, clean under sync (argmax 205=205 the moment a sync lands).
  v1 syncs per projection; the real fix is a single-kernel grouped GEMM (CUTLASS).
- One-time cublas init ~10% of a cold prime — warmed by a dummy grouped call at first use.
Numbers (d1736, interleaved x3): g26 f16g 10574-11289 vs mmq 10154-10193 (+4-11%, peak
11.9k pre-jitter; the per-proj syncs cap it); q35 FLAT (5452-5463 — its expert share is
small). Gates: g26 + q35 argmax MATCH (f16-mirror class, maxdiff 3.2 / 0.84). Door stays
OPT-IN until the sync tax dies and the 5090 battery arbitrates.
q27 board bring-up started: qwen3next arch alias added (upstream-converted GGUFs);
artifacts = unsloth Q4_K_M MTP-baked GGUF (17GB) + Qwen/Qwen3.6-27B-FP8 (31GB) onto the
box's empty 3.5TB NVMe (root volume at 93%). The 20260730 bw24-vs-llama board rows recovered
into the repo (the box-only-evidence lesson, second find).

Round 47 update — q27 ON THE BOARD (2026-08-01): the 27B hybrid was "honestly absent"
(NVFP4-only artifact, sm_120a-only kernels). Bring-up = one arch alias (qwen3next) +
public artifacts (unsloth Q4_K_M MTP-baked GGUF; Qwen/Qwen3.6-27B-FP8 for the vLLM arm;
both on the box NVMe) + a bench_vllm max_num_seqs cap (hybrid Mamba cache blocks reject
the 1024 default). First light loaded and generated coherently on the first run; argmax
gate MATCH; **validate-h100 --quick ALL GATES GREEN on the first battery** (decode-batch,
decode-dc, graph-decode with kernel-class segments, graph-session — a fresh hybrid
through the whole harness). Board cell (N=5, real text, same-session): memra decode
87.5 / prefill 1965 -> e2e 74.3 vs vLLM FP8 74.3 / 15054 -> 72.9. **e2e 1.02x WIN,
decode 1.18x, UNTUNED** (no per-model FA defaults swept, Q4_K decode as-is; prefill
0.13x = the known dense int8-GEMM dtype edge + zero tuning). Board: 7 models, e2e 5/7,
decode 6/7. 5090 battery: correctness + serve-smoke GREEN (alias additive, F16G door
default-off).

Round 47 update 2 — q27 win-harder arc (2026-08-01, "most-used model" directive):
1. MTP SPEC WORKS ON sm_90a: the unsloth artifact's baked-in NextN head rides run-spec
   green — K sweep (128 tok, real prompt): K=2 107.7 (76.5% accept) / K=3 113.0 (67.4%) /
   K=4 106.2 (60.5%). K=3 = 1.45x plain decode; a spec board row would read ~92 e2e vs
   vLLM 72.9 (1.26x) — needs the spec-vs-vLLM-best harness (vLLM MTP support TBD).
2. Q6_K f16 MIRRORS: the q27 prefill wall was qmatvec_gemm_q6_K at 6.7ms/call (the
   Q4_K_M mix packs attn_v/ffn_down/head as Q6_K; no MMQ arm exists for Q6_K; Q4_K
   already rides mul_mat_q_q45k). Dequant kernel verified against qmatvec.cu's q6_K
   indexing; admission model-class-agnostic (the round-45 qwen flip evidence was Q8_0-
   specific). q27 pp2048 1963 -> 3225 (+64%, x3 interleaved), argmax MATCH (maxdiff
   0.85). Board cell re-measured: e2e 78.5 vs 72.9 = 1.08x (from 1.02x).
3. Research sweep banked (research/moe-levers-20260801/): 6-agent recon of
   vLLM/SGLang/llama.cpp/KTransformers/LMCache/arxiv + cloud scaling. Ranked lever queue
   in task #32 (ragged token-tiles first — the 2-4x tile-padding waste at 20-65
   tok/expert is the direct attack on both remaining losses). Infra verdict in #33:
   bench box stays bench-only, spot 1xH100 instance $2.63/hr for dev, quota headroom
   +47 boxes, skip MIG.

## Round 48 — g26 decode: the router knife-edge was roulette (+12.7%), ragged tiles refuted (2026-08-01)

Two lane2 arcs on the rented H100 box, both receipts-complete:

1. RAGGED TOKEN-TILES (lever #1 from the round-47 queue) REFUTED: {64,96,128} avg-pairs
   dispatch for mmq_iq_experts costs -7.6% q35 pp2048 at ANY sub-128 tile (attribution
   arm -0.4%; 96-floor probe == ragged mix). Mechanism: the Y-gather already skips
   clamped tail columns (round 46 inc4) so tile-128 padding waste was dead MMA only —
   and the kernel is latency-bound, so dead MMA was free AND hid the W-stage/Y-gather
   latency; smaller tiles expose it. A future ragged attempt must invert the loop nest
   (dequant W once per kb, walk token sub-tiles inside). g26 control flat. Mechanism
   preserved on lane/ragged-tiles (tip reverts it); receipts
   research/ragged-tiles-20260801/.
2. G26 DECODE DIG (lane/g26-decode): honest wall table by two-capture nsys subtraction
   (NGEN 16 vs 528, prime cancels exactly): router_gemv_f32 763.9us/step = 15.8% (25.4us
   x 30 layers — round-44 number reproduced). The round-44 gemma4 w8 block RE-ARBITRATED
   on 6 real prompts x both arms: w8's gate outcome IDENTICAL to lone-warp on all six
   (the one MISMATCH prompt fails BOTH arms with the same argmax pair — router-
   independent). Verdict: single-synthetic-prompt roulette, exactly the round-45 class.
   FLIP LANDED: gemma4 rides the global ROUTER_W8_DEFAULT — g26 decode 182.6 -> 205.7
   depth / 180.9 -> 204.2 board (+12.7/+12.9%, naked-vs-naked x3 interleaved, all
   argmax MATCH; router now 114us/step = 2.7%). Cross-day vLLM 194.6 NOT re-benched —
   board harness re-run required for a publishable cell. Bounded increment on the next
   wall (gelu gate_up slot-packing _j8/_j8r2, bit-identical rows) measured -2.5%/-2.9%
   -> killed per flags doctrine (grid 704x8 1-warp CTAs beat 704x1 8-warp packing).
   Next rungs: gate_up+down8 fusion (25% combined, 15-30% of SOL), fa chain (~20%),
   q6_K LM head (323us, 7.8%). Receipts research/g26-decode-20260801/.

Round 48 — q27 K-QUANT SPLIT-PLANE DECODE MIRRORS (2026-08-01, lane/q27-decode-bw):
the byte-normalized head-to-head (vLLM FP8 decode 79.9 at 1.7x our weight bytes vs our
78-79) said the q27 decode leaves H100 bandwidth unused. ncu (receipts in
research/q27-decode-bw-20260801/): qmatvec_q4_K_mmvq holds DRAM 41-54% with 65%
excessive sectors ("uncoalesced global accesses"), qmatvec_q6_K_mmvq 40-47% with 78% —
the 144B/210B GGUF superblock strides are the Q8_0 34B-stride disease (2026-07-26) on
K-quants. Fix = the same split-plane recipe: load-time mirrors (q4_K: qs plane ++ 16B
meta plane; q6_K: ql ++ qh ++ scales ++ d planes; same total bytes, MEMRA_KQRP seam,
hopper-default) + bit-identical rp twins (m=1 mmvq_rp, batched b2/b4/b8_rp, q6_K b16_rp;
q6_K rp keeps PDL wave-A). After-ncu: q4_K hot shape 52% -> 61-64% DRAM (excessive
sectors 65% -> 32%), 28.8 -> 24.6us; q6_K fat call 54.6 -> 44.0us (40 -> 50% DRAM).
E2E (interleaved x3, same-session): PLAIN 77-78 -> 88-91 tok/s (+15-16% all three prompt
classes), SPEC K=3+HPOST+PMIN0.3 board-2048 103.7 -> 109.2 / short 127.2 -> 133.4 /
agentic 137.9 -> 144.8 (+5%), acceptance IDENTICAL per class (bit-identity holds e2e).
Gates: kernel-check ALL GREEN incl. 13 new KQRP bit-bad=0 gates (m=1..12, both dtypes),
run-gen argmax MATCH (board-2048), run-spec K=1..8 SELF-CONSISTENCY PASS x3 classes.
Board math: spec e2e 92.5 -> ~96.2 vs vLLM FP8+MTP-best 140.9 (gap 1.52x -> 1.46x).
REMAINING HEADROOM (next attack): the hot q4_K shape still shows 32% excessive sectors
and 61-64% DRAM — the paired-lane chunk redundancy and the byte-granular meta/scale
reads are the residue; a lane->chunk remap (each lane owns its own 32B chunk) is the
follow-up probe. Mirrors are VRAM-paid (trunk-sized) — hopper-lane only, 5090 untouched
(sm_120a build byte-identical, MEMRA_KQRP defaults off without memra_hopper_mma).

Round 49 — q27 KQRP MIRROR v2: LANE->CHUNK REMAP (2026-08-01, lane/q4k-remap): the
round-48 residue attacked head-on. Receipt arithmetic first (research/
q4k-chunk-remap-20260801/): the hot 4352-grid q4_K shape's 3,046,400 excessive sectors
decompose EXACTLY into a-loads 2x16 exc x 5 iters x 17408 rows = 2,785,280 + meta byte
reads ~261k; the qs paired-lane redundancy never shows in "excessive" (per-instruction
metric) — it doubles L1TEX weight wavefronts instead (every qs sector requested twice).
Fix (mirror layout v2, load-time = free; plane offsets unchanged, Rust untouched):
(a) qs/ql intra-superblock chunk repack — each grp owns one 16B nibble-packed chunk
(wpack[k] = k<4 ? wv[k]&0x0F0F0F0F : (wv[k-4]>>4)&0x0F0F0F0F, byte-equal to v1), q6_K
qh crumb-repacked to 8B/grp; warp windows become dense 512B/256B, ONE load per plane
per g-iter. (b) q4_K meta = ONE int4 + register extraction; q6_K scales = ONE 2B load.
Same values, same fold order — 13 KQRP bit-bad=0 gates + argmax MATCH + K=1..8 PASS
(acceptance per-K identical to base). ncu (dedicated GPU 2, 8xH100 box, interleaved):
q4_K hot 24.53 -> 23.81us, DRAM 63.6 -> 65.7%, TOTAL sectors -22% (9.59M -> 7.50M);
q6_K 2560-grid 26.43 -> 23.71us (-10.3%, DRAM 50.9 -> 56.7); q6_K 1280-grid 43.46 ->
36.54us (-15.9%, DRAM 51.6 -> 61.5). E2E interleaved x5 medians, plain ranges cleanly
separated: short 90.66 -> 92.89 (+2.5%), board-2048 88.74 -> 92.24 (+3.9%), agentic
90.87 -> 93.20 (+2.6%); spec K=3 flat within noise (-1.1/+0.9/-0.8%, ranges overlap).
REFUTED with numbers (receipts mmvq-after-c-*): the a-side dense-window + warp-shuffle
exchange (16 SHFL/iter) achieves the coalescing goal — ncu's uncoalesced rule stops
firing entirely — yet REGRESSES every shape (hot q4_K 23.81 -> 27.33us, DRAM 57%;
q6_K 44.06us): SHFL through the LSU pipe costs more than the a-sector savings on a
latency-bound kernel. Killed same-day; direct a-loads stay. Residual excessive
(37%/34%) is now PURELY the activation 16B@32B-stride loads — only reachable via a
global q8_1 activation-buffer layout change (touches every mmvq consumer; unprobed).

## Round 49 — q27 Q4_K f16 PREFILL MIRRORS: +54% pp2048 default, +105% at full coverage (2026-08-01, lane/q4k-f16-mirrors)

Q4_K joins the f16-mirror carve-out (Q8_0 07-26, Q4_0 campaign-A, Q6_K round 47): the
q27 trunk bulk (294 Q4_K tensors) rode mul_mat_q_q45k int8-MMA for prefill — good, but
the cuBLASLt f16 lane beats that class at large m. memra_q4kf16_dequant_kernel
(f16_prefill.cu): 144B superblock, d*sc*q - dmin*mn, get_scale_min_k4 6-bit unpack
verified against qmatvec.cu's deq_q4_k; admission in build_q8_f16 (in_f%256, 144B rows);
model-class-agnostic carve-out in the Q8RP walk, arbitrated by per-model argmax gates.
DESIGN: Q4_K admits as a SECOND budget pass so MEMRA_PP_F16_BUDGET_MB keeps FULL Q6_K
coverage as its floor (Q6_K replaces a ~10x dequant-GEMM; Q4_K upgrades a working MMA
arm — a joint walk would evict late-layer Q6_K mirrors for the weaker lever).
NUMBERS (interleaved x3, N=3 medians, same-session, GPU 3; receipts
research/q4k-f16-mirrors-20260801/): pp2048 board 3205 -> 4935 (+54%), agentic-634
2781 -> 4403 (+58%); plain decode FLAT (88.5/90.2 -> 89.6/89.8 — decode never touches
the mirror). Budget probe (x2): default 32768MB admits 183/294 (22.4GB) after Q6_K;
43008MB admits 265/294 (32.7GB) -> pp2048 6564 (+105% vs base, +33% vs default), VRAM
peak 76.3/81.5GB. SPEC-ACCEPTANCE FIND: at default budget board-2048 spec K=3 drops
109.9 -> 101.4 (acc 66.1 -> 57.3) while agentic RISES 144.2 -> 146.4 (acc 84 -> 86);
at 43008 the board acceptance RECOVERS (64.8, spec 109.4 ~ parity) — the dip is a
partial-coverage artifact (layer-prefix mirror mixes f16-prime and int8-prime numerics
mid-trunk), single-prompt evidence per the round-45/48 roulette law. e2e board-2048:
plain 72.5 -> 78.2 (+7.9%); spec 86.3 -> 87.1 default / ~96.5 (+11.8%) at 43008.
GATES ALL GREEN: kernel-check 0 fails — Q4_K f16 gates NEW (rel 4.1-4.4e-3, band 1e-2)
plus the round-47 Q6_K f16 gates that had NO battery entry (law 3: added, rel
3.5-4.3e-3); run-gen argmax MATCH both budgets (maxdiff 6.5e-1 / 5.1e-1 — NO round-45
flip, the class HOLDS on the q27 hybrid); run-spec K=1..8 all PASS; q35 argmax MATCH
(zero Q4_K tensors — untouched; ditto q9-Q8_0 and the gemma q4_0 artifacts, so the
fleet blast radius is q27 only); validate-h100 --quick ALL GATES GREEN on the new
binary (graph-decode/graph-session included — the captured prime graph bakes f16 GEMM
pointers, the untested surface for mirrors joining the prime path). Default budget stays 32768 (a hopper-wide bump moves
VRAM on every model per box); serving configs set MEMRA_PP_F16_BUDGET_MB per model —
machine-specific config per flags doctrine. NEXT RUNG: Q5_K (48 tensors, 3GB @2B/w)
is the remaining non-f16 trunk class; full-coverage budget as a q27 serving default is
the open owner call (5.2GB headroom at 43008).

Round 49b — Q5_K f16 mirrors landed as the THIRD budget pass (strictly after all
Q4_K, so the default composition and every banked 49 gate stays byte-identical —
verified: same 183 q4k mirrors, argmax maxdiff bit-same 6.513e-1). memra_q5kf16_
dequant_kernel: 176B superblock, same get_scale_min_k4, qh bit g of qh[l], verified
vs deq_q5_k. Battery case added (blk.0.ssm_out Q5_K GEMM rel 3.2e-7 + f16 mirror rel
2.4-6.0e-3); q5k-active argmax MATCH (4.231e-1); K-sweep 8/8 PASS. Marginal probe
(x2, KQRP off to free VRAM): full stack q6k+q4k(35.6GB)+q5k(2.9GB) -> pp2048 prime
0.254s = 8063 tok/s (+152% vs base); q5k tail ~9.5ms/GB. ON THIS BOX the tier is
dark in the serving config (full q4k+q6k already exceeds the budget that fits beside
the round-48 KQRP decode mirrors) — it pays on bigger-VRAM boxes; implemented +
battery-gated either way. The REAL owner call this exposes: on 80GB, f16-mirror
budget vs KQRP decode mirrors compete for the same ~15GB — prefill 6564->8063 vs
decode +15% cannot both max out; per-box serving configs choose.

## Round 49 — ZERO LOSSES (2026-08-01): the board sweep completes

Final same-session cells on the promoted tree: **q35 e2e 217.8 vs 214.3 (1.02x)** —
decode 242.9 (shexp dot + KQRP stack) x prefill 8428 (the grouped f16 expert lane at
41/41 dequant coverage, Hopper default; the round-47 "flat" verdict was a 1-of-41-layers
coverage artifact). **q27 e2e 95.5 vs 72.9 (1.31x)** — decode 103.7 (KQRP + layout v2)
x prefill 4821 (Q4_K/Q5_K/Q6_K f16 mirrors, default budget; 43008MB serving config
measured 1.16x plain/1.38x spec on the board shape). Board: 6 wins + 1 even + 0 losses,
decode 7/7. Batteries: validate-h100 ALL GREEN (f16g default + gate prime-nuisance pin,
the K4/K5 precedent), 5090 correctness + serve-smoke GREEN. The M0 comms spike banked
the multi-GPU floor (PP ~free, EP<=4, graphed a2a mandatory) for the GLM-5.2 build.

## Round 50 — the f16g default is PER-MODEL: gemma-gelu class OFF (2026-08-01, lane/f16g-permodel)

The round-49 Hopper default (`MEMRA_MOE_F16G=1`) REGRESSED g26 board-2048 prefill -8.3%:
interleaved x5 on-box, def median 10380 tok/s with a wild 8.9k-11.7k spread vs off 11317
±0.13% (the +6-15% probe verdict didn't survive the board workload — the stale-verdict
law claims another one). Fix: `moe_f16g_gemma_on()` — the gemma gelu-MoE dispatch site
(hybrid_forward.rs) defaults OFF, explicit `=1`/`=2` still opens the door; the silu/qwen
admission (q35, +53%) keeps the round-49 default. Gate verification: g26 naked 11322
(off arm) / =1 10244+9828 (door opens), q35 naked 8455 / =0 5498 (default untouched),
argmax MATCH on all arms. Batteries: q35 validate-h100 --quick ALL GATES GREEN; g26
kernel-check + decode-dc green, decode-batch/graph gates = the round-46 pre-existing
gemma-MoE coverage gap (verbatim panics receipted). New naked g26 cell (N=5 medians both
arms, 10:53Z same-session block): memra prefill 11337.1 / decode 210.30 -> e2e 978.9 vs
vLLM FP8-dynamic 43964.4 / 194.73 -> 956.7 = **1.023x** (decode is the cell's best to
date: 180.87 -> 182.09 -> 204.57 -> 210.30). Receipts:
`research/f16g-permodel-20260801/` (A/B, gate logs, batteries, board jsonl + raw runs).

## Round 51 — sk128 persistent-visitor grouped GEMM: +4.2%, cublas parity NOT reached (2026-08-01, lane/sk-bm128)

The mode-2 single-kernel grouped GEMM (round 49's `MEMRA_F16G_SK` arm) rebuilt as a
persistent problem-visitor over the REAL CSR tiles: a grid-stride flat tile list from a
smem prefix over the device offsets kills the round-49 grid's ~92% early-exit churn under
q35's ~17x group skew. Two tile forms: 32x64x32 2-stage (the round-49 geometry) and
128x64x64 3-stage cp.async — cutlass's tile shape on the same sm_80-portable mma.sync
m16n8k16, no wgmma/TMA; hybrid split at `MEMRA_F16G_SK_CROSS` (per-arch swept: H100 32,
5090 64). Every form is BYTE-IDENTICAL to the round-49 kernel (same ascending mma k-chain
per element; kernel-check f16g-sk section maxdiff 0.00e0 on BOTH rigs, identical values —
deterministic k-chain). VERDICT (x5 interleaved process rounds x3 arms round-robin, each
the median of 5 in-process reps, same box same hour): old grid-scan 7966.1 / new visitor
8299.9 / cublas mode-1 8563.2 tok/s board-2048 prime — **new vs old +4.2%, zero overlap;
new = 96.9% of cublas — PARITY NOT REACHED, mode 1 keeps the Hopper default**. The 5090
mode-2 arm wins outright: 3403.7 -> 3568.4 (+4.8% interleaved x5, zero overlap; GEMM
stage -9.4% by nsys) — but MMQ stays the sm_120a default (mode 2 is the experimental
door on both arches). RESIDUAL, PRICED (nsys N=1, mechanism evidence): sk GEMM stage
131.9ms (sk128v 90.5 + sk32v 41.3) vs cutlass grouped 101.6 + h2f_rows_scale 10.8 =
112.4ms (cublas also pays a host stream-sync per projection the kernel sum can't see) —
the 32x64 2-stage TAIL form is 41.3ms = 31% of stage time; the crossover fine-sweep
(x8..x512, winner 32) refuted pushing tail groups onto sk128, so the next rung is a
deeper tail form (BK=64 3-stage at small BM, or register double-buffering). Gates:
kernel-check ALL GREEN both rigs (incl the in_f=480 %32-not-%64 forced-128 fallback
case), run-gen argmax MATCH with maxdiff identical old-vs-new on each rig, run-spec
K=1..8 PASS with acceptance counts identical to the round-49 receipt. First-run find:
static __half smem tiles after the 2052B prefix landed 4-aligned ->
CUDA_ERROR_MISALIGNED_ADDRESS on cp.async/ldmatrix; `__align__(16)` on all smem tiles.
sk128's 82944B dynamic smem needs the >48KB opt-in — SetAttribute CHECKED with device-fit
fallback (1 CTA/SM x 8 warps on sm_120a; H100's 228KB admits 2/SM). Receipts:
`research/sk-bm128-20260801/` (5090 + `h100/`).

Round-51 adjacent, serving: batched-tick increment 3 (5090 lane,
`research/batched-tick-inc3-20260801/`) shipped the per-model EXACT-16 decode chunk tier
(`decode_batch_exact16_ok`; Q8_0 qualifies only through the q8rp `_rp` mirror twins) —
the pre-inc2 fleet-lane cap-15/16 "flat-or-worse" verdict was re-swept after inc2 made the
tick weight-stream-bound (LAW 2 claims another stale verdict) and chunk 16 measured
+18.8% at c=16 same-mirror on the 5090. On THIS lane the 9B Q8_0 fleet model qualifies
automatically (`MEMRA_Q8RP` defaults ON under `memra_hopper_mma`), so the next fleet
deploy runs chunk 16 — every H100 serve number in this ledger is chunk-8-era, and the
chunk-16 fleet effect on Hopper is PENDING on-box re-validation (no H100 receipts exist
yet; do not quote the 5090 delta as a fleet claim). The emit-defer arm (one D2H per tick
instead of per chunk) measured FLAT (±0.7% at every load point — 3 saved syncs vs a
~100ms weight-bound tick) and was KILLED per the flags doctrine; the JSONL rows are the
record.

## Round 52 — the exactness arc: the m-dependent prefill router changed expert routing by co-arrival (2026-08-02, lanes concat-prime-exact / router-fix-recells / fast-router)

A REAL serving defect, found by the serve gate and fixed at the dispatch level. The
greedy c=1-vs-c=16 serve gate failed byte identity on the onboards (Ornith-35B 6/16,
KAT 7/16) and the razor chain pinned the mechanism: solo-vs-concat divergence is a pure
function of TOTAL m — piecewise-constant thresholds at m=65/75, reproduced ascending AND
descending (not process state), while the determinism, session-offset, and content
razors all came back BIT-IDENTICAL (no indexing/masking/rope defect). The m-invariance
probes caught both culprits: the cuBLASLt prefill router GEMM (`ffn_gate_inp` — rows
[0,19) move maxdiff 3.9e-3 between m=19 and m=65) and the cuBLASLt shexp gate dot
(1.07e-4 between m=74 and m=75); 36 trunk weights probed m-INVARIANT. Route trace at
total_m=75: **16% of (layer,token) pairs got a different expert SET than solo**
(121/760; first set-diff layer3 tok6, expert 39->157). NOT post-train-specific: the
SUPPORTED Qwen3.6-35B control has the SAME m=65/75 thresholds, and the "post-trains
have ~10x tighter margins" theory is REFUTED — the supported control has the TIGHTEST
prefill margins of the three (min 0.069 vs Ornith 0.207). Fix (b3a5465f): the MoE
prefill router + shexp gate ride decode's m-invariant `router_gemv` /
`sigmoid_dot_rows` at every t — `MEMRA_ROUTER_PREFILL_EXACT` default ON (`=0` is a
numeric A/B seam that forfeits the isolation guarantee). Serve gate after: **16/16 on
all four models** (Ornith-9B + q35 ctrl stayed 16/16 throughout). The serving contract
is now explicit: **greedy serving is isolated-identical under concurrent load at
defaults.** Receipts `research/concat-prime-exact-20260802/` (findings.jsonl + the full
mscan/razor/trace/margin logs).

H100 re-cells (`lane/router-fix-recells`, `research/router-fix-recells-20260802/`): the
fix costs q35 board-2048 expert prefill **-13.0%** on Hopper (exact0 8444.2 vs naked
7346.9, interleaved x3, same session — steeper than the 5090's -10%: the exact arms
displace a larger share of the grouped-f16 expert-prefill budget). **q35 ROW MOVES:
218 -> 215 e2e, 1.02x -> 1.00x dead-even** (N=5 same-session interleaved pair vs vLLM
FP8; decode unchanged at 243.5). **q27 ROW STANDS at 1.31x** — bit-stable prefill AND
decode vs the pre-fix session, and proven not-on-the-fixed-path three ways (gguf
metadata: dense `qwen35`, `is_moe()`=false; code: the fix touches MoE-only arms;
measurement). argmax MATCH on every run, both models. The exactness contract was paid
out of the board's best cell and the board stays loss-free.

Recovery (`lane/fast-router`, `research/fast-router-20260802/`): the fix's cost was a
GEMV program at GEMM shape — one 8-warp block per (expert, token) output, operand rows
re-streamed per output, zero reuse. The batch twin (`router_gemv_f32_w8_batch`) computes
an 8x8 (expert x token) register tile whose per-row reduction chains are IDENTICAL to
the w8 form (same tid-strided k order, same shuffle tree, same serial fold — only where
operands come from changes), so **the fast form IS the exact form**. kernel-check gained
a weight-oracle section — real q35 router weights, 32 m-points in 1..2048, bit-compare +
m-invariance — mism=0 from first build through every iteration. Crossover swept, not
guessed: `ROUTER_BATCH_MIN_T = 8` (t=4 0.68x, t=8 1.09x, t=2048 3.54x); decode t=1 and
spec verify t<8 keep the plain form (bit-equal either way). 5090 recovery, interleaved
x5 N=5 medians: q35 board-2048 prefill 3524 (pre-fix cuBLASLt) -> 3167 (fix) ->
**3417 (twin)** — 70% of the regression back, -3.1% vs the banned m-dependent kernel;
o35b resident pp512 -0.5% vs pre-fix. Killed arms (bit-identity-green before dying,
JSONL is the record): the 8x16 tile (128 accumulators cost the occupancy its halved
w-traffic needs) and the sigmoid-dot batch twin (out_f=1 is launch-latency-bound).
`MEMRA_ROUTER_BATCH=0` is the perf-only rollback seam — it can never change output bits.
Found on the way: the c=16 serve-admission OOM under resident-if-fits (instant HTTP 400s
with zero mismatches, quoted `cache alloc failed: CUDA_ERROR_OUT_OF_MEMORY`) — fixed
with a VRAM-aware admission wait in worker.rs (after the first admit observes a model's
per-session VRAM cost, further admissions need free >= 2x that cost or the request waits
in the never-rejected FIFO; first session always admits, empty-active OOM still errors).
The H100 q35 row's post-twin re-cell is IN FLIGHT on a parallel lane as of this entry;
the published row stands at the post-fix 215 / 1.00x.

**Round-52 closure (same day, `lane/q35-recell-final`,
`research/q35-recell-final-20260802/`):** the in-flight re-cell landed. On Hopper the
batch router recovers **82.3%** of the exactness cost (naked 8186.7 vs batch0 7299.1 vs
exact0 8377.6, interleaved x3 same session — -2.3% net vs the pre-fix reference), and
the full same-session N=5 board pair reads **q35 217.0 vs vLLM 214.8 = 1.01x** — the
row is back ahead with the contract held. kernel-check's fast-router weight-oracle
section (real q35 router weights, 32 m-points, bit-compare + m-invariance) ran GREEN on
sm_90a before any measurement: the batch twin is bit-identical and m-invariant on
Hopper exactly as on the 5090.

## Round 53 — battery semantics: gate1 goes fraction-ruled (#47); IQ4_XS trunk dp4a arch-global (2026-08-02, lanes gate1-recal / kat-anomaly / prime-gate-coverage — docs-lane ledger entry)

Three arch-global merges this round touch surfaces validate-h100.sh or H100 operators
see; none of them re-measured Hopper perf, and the board is untouched.

**gate1-config is now the fraction rule (#47).** decode-batch-gate's config-mode gate1 —
the leg validate-h100.sh runs at B=8 — verdicts FAIL iff **>= 4 of the 6
`MEMRA_GATE_SEED` draws diverge before step 3**, replacing round 45's "any draw < step
3" floor. The round-45 rule was calibrated on this box's dice (first divergences at
steps 7/8/15, zero early in 6 draws) and did not transfer: 5090 dice land at steps 0
and 1, and they are proven DICE, not plumbing — the exact worst draws are bit-identical
for all 32 steps under the strict-equalized composition (LAW 2, stale-verdict, again).
The fraction rule separates at margin 2 on both sides: observed legal dice reach at
most 2 early draws per 6-window; the plumbing class (wrong token fed, KV misindexed)
diverges at step 0-2 on EVERY draw. Teeth proven, not assumed: `MEMRA_GATE_CANARY=1`
(test-only door — feed the batched lane one wrong token at step 1) fails 6/6 draws
early with exit 1 on both gate models. For this box the change is a pure widening — the
observed H100 dice sit far inside the rule — and gate2 (bit strength), gate3, and
strict mode are untouched as the hard exactness floor. Receipts
`research/gate1-recal-20260802/`.

**IQ4_XS trunk dp4a admission is default ON — arch-global (#42).** `iq_fast_enabled()`
(lib.rs): non-expert IQ4_XS matmuls ride `qmatvec_iq4_XS_dp4a` instead of the Stage-A
f32 oracle path at every m; `MEMRA_IQ_FAST=0` is the rollback seam (FLAGS §3). The 5090
lane proved the flip (KAT-Coder decode 106.7 -> 193.4, +81.3%, x5 interleaved) and the
supported-set no-op guard (no board artifact carries IQ4_XS NON-expert 2-D matmuls —
the q35 UD-IQ4_XS trunk is Q8_0 throughout, per the tensor-mix dumps; ctrl bit-identity
guard sha-exact pre/post flip). The same static tensor-mix argument covers the H100
board set (Q8_0 / Q4_K_M / IQ4_XS-UD / QAT Q4_0 — none with IQ4_XS trunks), and the
on-box verification CONFIRMED it: q35 token streams bit-identical naked vs
`MEMRA_IQ_FAST=0` on every paired run (board-2048 7v7, p2 3v3), perf flat <2% with
overlapping ranges (the box's bimodal decode visited by both arms — order-flipped reps
killed the arm hypothesis), `validate-h100.sh --quick` exit 0 under the new gate1
fraction rule, AUTO-KQUANT proven mode-1 on Hopper by cfg gate. One pre-existing
find: q35+pp512 trips run-gen's hard argmax assert (the documented 365/198 near-tie,
margins 0.115/0.077; v0.63.0 control fails identically to the digit — the cell had
never been run on H100; owner call = near-tie tolerance in the assert or ledger-only).
Receipts `research/kat-anomaly-20260802/` + `research/h100-v064-verify-20260802/`.

**run-gen grew a second gate line — arch-global (#46).** Board argmax-sanity runs on
this box now also print `batched-prime argmax=... {MATCH|FLIP-NEARTIE|
MISMATCH-STRUCTURED}`: `prime_cache` (the config that seeds real generation and
serving) vs the tokenwise reference, verdicts by bounds calibrated on the 2026-08-02
six-model 5090 sweep (`MEMRA_PRIME_GATE_MAXDIFF=8.0` / `_MARGIN=1.0`; 10/144 first
tokens legally flip at margins <= 0.70, dense Q8_0 — the fleet class — 0/48).
FLIP-NEARTIE is reported non-fatal; STRUCTURED fails the run. The bounds obey LAW 2:

no run-gen leg, so H100 exposure is via the board scripts' argmax-sanity runs).

## Round 54 — sk + direct-from-quant loaders re-asked on H100: NO FLIP, mode 1 stays (2026-08-02, lane/h100-sk-direct)

The sm_120a direct-from-quant Q4_K/Q6_K tile loaders (lane/kquant-tile-loaders — the
dequant-workspace kill, byte-identical by construction, Ornith pp512 +89% on the 5090)
re-opened the round-51 question: does `MEMRA_MOE_F16G=2` + direct now pass the cublas
mode-1 Hopper default? Gates first: kernel-check sm_90a ALL GREEN 0 FAIL —
`f16g-kq-direct` maxdiff=0.00e0 byte-identical 6/6 (synthetic q4_K/q6_K, all three
visitor forms; real-weight sub-cases KC-SKIP, no ornith/KAT gguf on this box),
`iq4xs-mmq` synth rel <= 1.70e-4. VERDICT (q35 board-2048 prime, three arms interleaved
x5 round-robin under one lock hold, argmax MATCH 15/15 incl the batched-prime gate):
cublas 8547.1 / sk+direct 8112.1 / sk-workspace 8074.2 tok/s — **sk+direct = 94.9% of
cublas, NO FLIP, zero overlap; mode 1 keeps the Hopper naked default**. The direct
loaders beat the workspace form +0.47% (zero overlap) — exactly coverage-proportional:
q35's bank carries only 4/123 Q4_K/Q6_K expert projections (0.81 GB of ~15.6 GB = 5.2%
of bank bytes); the IQ3_S/IQ4_XS bulk keeps the workspace pass + visitor GEMM, so the
5.1% residual is round 51's priced residual unchanged (32x64 tail form 31% of stage) —
no new nsys, no kernel on that class moved. `MEMRA_F16G_SK_CROSS` re-swept on the
direct arm {16,32,64}: 7999.6 / 8094.9 / 8079.7 — **cross=32 confirmed**, the direct
form does not move the crossover. The flip rung, if ever: direct-from-quant loaders for
IQ4_XS/IQ3_S superblocks (the 94.8%) and/or the deeper sk32 tail form. Cross-session
note (LAW 1): the gap read 3.1% at round 51 (pre router-fix) vs 5.1% today — both
same-session interleaved; the widening is cross-day + round-52 code motion, and no
conclusion rests on it. Battery: validate-h100.sh --quick (q35) post-probe, ALL GATES
GREEN rc=0 — the b9bd9d4c tree (kquant-tile-loaders merged) is battery-clean on this
box. No board cell ran (no default change); board files untouched. Receipts

## Round 55 — full direct coverage + deep tail: mode 2 FLIPS past cublas +52.6%, Hopper default moves; q35 row 217 -> 226 (2026-08-02, lane/h100-flip-full)

Round 54's NO-FLIP was coverage-priced: direct loaders covered 5.2% of q35's bank.
The tree since gained IQ4_XS/IQ3_S direct tiles (lane/iq-direct-loaders — ~100% bank
coverage, 5090 mode-2 arm +50.5%) and the 32x64x64 3-stage deep tail
(lane/sk-tail-form, sm_80-portable). Re-asked on the e42cc8e1 tree. Gates first:
kernel-check sm_90a ALL GREEN rc=0 240 OK 0 FAIL — `f16g-kq-direct` byte-identical
maxdiff=0.00e0 on iq4_xs/iq3_s synthetic AND **real q35 weights** (blk.0 IQ3_S gate +
IQ4_XS down via ~/models), every visitor form incl both tail arms; same absent-model
KC-SKIP set as round 54. VERDICT (q35 board-2048 prime, three arms interleaved x5
round-robin under one lock hold, argmax + batched-prime MATCH 30/30): **cublas mode-1
8626.5 / mode-2 full form 13163.6 / mode-2 round-51 form 8073.4 tok/s — FLIP, mode 2 =
152.6% of cublas, zero overlap** (min 13132.8 >> max 8643.7). The round-51 reference
arm reproduces round 54's sk-ws cell to 0.01% (8073.4 vs 8074.2) — the whole +63% over
it is direct + tail: the workspace pass was the entire gap and then some, HBM3
notwithstanding. `MEMRA_F16G_SK_CROSS` re-swept on the full form {16,32,64}:
12868.3 / 13192.4 / **13224.7** — 64 wins, the cross=32 verdict (swept round 51,
re-confirmed round 54) went STALE when B tiles stopped riding the workspace (LAW 2,
third instance on this flag); the unset default 64 is now the swept winner on both
rigs, no per-arch value. FLIP SHIPPED: `moe_f16g_mode()` Err arm `cfg!(memra_hopper_mma)`
1 -> 2 (lib.rs); the gemma (gelu) door is untouched by construction —
`moe_f16g_gemma_on()` reads the env directly (Err => closed) and never consults the
mode's Err arm; sm_120a keeps AUTO-KQUANT mode 3. Battery on the flipped tree:
validate-h100.sh --quick (q35) **ALL GATES GREEN** (decode-batch gates pin F16G=0
in-binary — immune by design). Board cell (tools/h100-vllm-board.sh, N=5 medians both
arms, same-session pair, naked = flipped default): memra decode 242.60 / prefill
13257.9 -> **e2e 226.1** vs vLLM FP8 decode 225.35 / prefill 18221.3 -> e2e 214.7 —
**q35 ROW MOVES 217 vs 215 = 1.01x -> 226 vs 215 = 1.05x**; decode flat (242.92 ->
242.60), the whole move is prefill 8136.2 -> 13257.9 (+63%). vLLM still primes faster
(18.2k vs 13.3k) — the residual prefill gap is the next rung, but it no longer decides
the row. Board jsonl `research/tune-data/h100board-vllm-20260731-realtext.jsonl`

## Round 56 — fa-decode-deep twins compile into sm_90a via the shared flash_attn.cu (2026-08-02, lane/fa-decode-deep — docs-lane ledger entry, no H100 numbers)

The deep fa_decode twins (`fa_decode_vec_q_v4_deep` / `_deep_dc`, default-on 2026-08-02)
live in the shared `crates/memra-engine/cu/flash_attn.cu` with no arch gate, so the sm_90a
build compiles and dispatches them exactly like sm_120a (hd256 non-gemma decode at
`t_kv >= 0`, `MEMRA_FA_DEEP=0` reverts). By construction this is NOT a numeric config —
kernel-check pins deep-vs-v4 BYTE identity (2 geometries x 6 depths x eager/dc/
bucketed-replay), and the pin now rides every validate-h100.sh run. NO H100 PERFORMANCE
CLAIM IS MADE HERE: the 1.43x d6144 kernel and flat-or-better depth cells are 5090
receipts (`research/fa-decode-deep-20260802/`); the deep twins' smem bank-conflict
premise (padded rows vs the 32-way score-phase conflict) is silicon-sensitive and
Hopper's smem banking may price it differently. The sm_90a validation — battery +
depth A/B — rides the next box battery window per the standing LAW 1/LAW 2 rules.

## Round 57 — the M0 "PP ~free" floor, priced (2026-08-02/06 — docs-lane ledger entry, scoping a round-49 line)

Round 49's closing line banked the M0 comms spike's multi-GPU floor as "PP ~free, EP<=4,
graphed a2a mandatory". That parenthetical has since been measured, and "~free" holds only
at N=2 and only for the serial arm. This ledger is append-only, so the round-49 line stands
as written and this entry is its scope.

**What "free" covers** (8xH100 SXM NVSwitch, `research/m2-pp8-20260802/RESULTS.md`, N=5
medians, same-session denominator, box otherwise idle): serial cross-device N=2 is
185.39 vs a 185.83 door-shut baseline on one GPU — inside the round-to-round band, which is
what confirms M0's 0.3-0.5% per-tick prediction. **What it does not cover, recorded as the
negative:** N=4 serial is 167.73 (0.90x) and N=8 is 165.12 (0.89x) — 3 to 7 boundary
crossings per token with no overlap to hide them, so ~10% is the honest N>2 serial cost, not
"~free". And the floor is only free if weights are placed per stage: the `MEMRA_PP_SHARD=0`
peer-read arms measure 55.53 / 42.76 / 38.65 tok/s at N=2/4/8 = a **3-4x cliff**. Sharding
is not an optimization on this box, it is the difference between a working and a broken
multi-GPU config.

The 1.87-1.88x pipelined figures in the same table are NOT a serving throughput claim — they
come from the deferred-readback bench loop keeping 3 tokens in flight, which plain
autoregressive serving cannot do (token N+1's input is token N's output). The pipelined arm
also remains QUARANTINED: same-device is refused outright (a reproduced 35% co-located-stream
race) and the cross-device record is ~69/70, one battery-5 dev01 flake with an OPEN root
cause. No H100 default changes on this entry.

Cross-rig note, since it bears on how the floor generalizes: the 2026-08-06 PP-2 batched work
on a rented 2x RTX PRO 6000 pair (`research/pp2-batch-20260806/`) priced the *batched* split
at 0.995x/0.989x/0.986x of the unsplit walk at B=4/8/16 with 0 differing bits across 7
configs, and found the same fail-closed necessity from the opposite direction — the unsplit
batched body under a sharded cross-device placement measured 28x slow at B=1 with all three
`decode-batch-gate` gates PASSING, because peer reads are byte-exact and only perf broke.
Those are sm_120a numbers on a Gen5 x16 pair, not NVSwitch, and are not promoted to this
ledger as H100 cells.
