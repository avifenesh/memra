# lane/step35-chunkfix — the step35 chunk-dependence defect, fixed and gated

**Mission:** close the one receipted exactness hole on THE SKU (Step-3.7-Flash). step35 prefill was
CHUNK-DEPENDENT past its 512-token SWA window: `MEMRA_PRIME_CHUNK` — documented in `docs/FLAGS.md`
as a machine-config/OOM knob an operator is invited to set per rig — changed the prefill logits, the
hidden rows, and the generated text.

**Defect receipt (not this lane's work, read it first):**
`research/step37-p2-20260806/raw/chunkinv-step35-GAP2-CONFIRMED-20260807.txt`, commit `66a81371`,
merged `9971e7f8`. That lane found, measured, and reduced the defect to a closed form, then
deliberately did NOT fix it (a kernel-selection change on the launch SKU's served prefill needs
before/after numbers per `research/benchmarks.md`, not a bring-up commit) and deliberately did NOT
land the matching gate (it would have been a known-red check). This lane does both.

---

## 1. The defect in one paragraph (from the receipt, not re-derived)

On SWA layers (33 of 45, `win=512`) step35's prime attention picked its kernel per chunk at
`hybrid_forward.rs:6820-6844`:

    off  = swa ? base_len.saturating_sub(win-1) : 0
    t_kv = base_len + t - off
    swa && t_kv > win  ->  sdpa_naive_w_quantized_view   (f32 windowed floor)
    else               ->  fa_prefill_view_ws            (hd128 dequant-once FA)

A chunk `[b,e)` with `b <= win-1` has `off = 0`, hence `t_kv = e`, hence it is FA iff `e <= win`;
every later chunk has `t_kv = t + (win-1) > win`. The FA rows were therefore a contiguous **prefix**
`[0,P)` with

    P = c * floor(win/c)   for c <= win ;   P = 0   for c > win

and the output depended **only** on `P`. The two kernels are not the same numeric class — swapping
them on the same rows moves the logits by ~1.8 — so the pre-fix comment "Same cache bytes, same
numeric class" was false as written. Measured at T=4883: `P(4096)=P(513)=0` mutually EXACT,
`P(512)=P(64)=512` mutually EXACT (10 chunks vs 77 — a reduction-order account forbids that) and
both DIFFER from the P=0 family by maxdiff `1.813e0` with greedy text diverging at step 6. `P`
differs across `{64,512,1024,2048,4096}` for 95.7% of prompt lengths under 12000, from T=513.

---

## 2. The fix: select on the REQUEST, not on the chunk

Commit `c809181d`. The arm predicate becomes `seq_end > win`, where `seq_end` is the **absolute end
position of the whole prime request** (`cache.pos + prompt_len`, computed **once** in `prime_cache`
before the chunk loop starts). Every chunk of a given request then evaluates the same predicate
whatever the chunk size, so `P` is identically 0 and `MEMRA_PRIME_CHUNK` is a pure memory knob again.

Threading: `prime_cache` -> `prime_chunk(..., seq_end)` -> `full_attn_prime(..., seq_end)` ->
`step35_attn_prime(..., seq_end)` -> `step35_attn_pre_wo(..., seq_end)`. Two paths pass `t` with a
`debug_assert` pinning why: `step35_attn` (cacheless prefill — `forward`/`forward_last`/t2probe, no
chunk loop exists there) and `prime_chunk_captured` (one unchunked bucket over a fresh cache). Those
asserts are the guard against a future chunked variant of either path silently re-opening the door.

**Why this is correct-by-construction, not a tolerance argument.** For `e <= win` the window mask is
a no-op under causal masking — that is precisely why the FA arm was legal on those rows in the first
place. The windowed kernel computes the same masked attention; it is now simply the only arm used
once the request passes the window. Nothing is being traded for invariance.

**Rollback seam / canary:** `MEMRA_STEP35_SWA_TKV=1` restores the pre-fix `t_kv` predicate. It is
chunk-variant by construction, which is exactly what gives the new gate teeth (see §4).

### 2.1 Enumeration: the shipped default cannot move

Before touching the box, the arm assignment was enumerated against the real loop
(`hybrid_forward.rs:461-477`, **including** the `PRIME_MIN_T=16` tail merge) pre- and post-fix:

| check | result |
|---|---|
| Post-fix `P` across `c` in `{0,2,16,32,64,128,256,384,512,513,600,768,1024,2048,4096,8192}`, for every T in [2,3000) plus {4096,4883,6257,8192,12000,16384,32768,120000} | **chunk-dependent at 0 values of T** |
| Pre-fix, same chunk set `{64,512,1024,2048,4096}`, T in [2,12000) | chunk-dependent at **11487 / 11998** values of T (matches the receipt's 95.7%) |
| `c=4096` (the shipped default) arm SEQUENCE, pre vs post, for every T in [2,20000) plus {32768,65536,120000,131072} | **IDENTICAL at every T — 0 differences** |
| smem ceiling: max `t_kv` among chunks that NEWLY take `naive_w`, over every (T,c) tested | **512** (= `win`), far under the `t_kv <= 12287` ceiling |
| pre-existing large-chunk ceiling cases (`c=12000`, T=131072: max naive `t_kv` = 12511) | **numerically unchanged** pre vs post — this lane neither creates nor fixes that |

Why the default is provably still: at `c=4096` on a `seq_end > win` prime, chunk 0 already had
`t_kv = min(chunk, seq_end) > win`, and every later chunk has `t_kv >= t + win - 1 > win` because
`PRIME_MIN_T` keeps `t >= 16`. A `seq_end <= win` prime keeps every chunk on FA exactly as before.
So the fix is a no-op on both default regimes and only removes the FA prefix at small chunk values.
**The perf measurement in §5 exists to confirm that prediction on silicon, not to discover it.**

## 3. Gate: `chunkinv35` / `chunkinv35c`

The finding lane named the assertion; this lane lands it, green, in the same commit as the fix.

    tools/chunk-invariance-gate.sh <step37.gguf> --label step35-swa \
        --prompts research/chunk-invariance-20260805/prompt-pp6257.txt \
        --chunks 4096,513,512,256,64 --seam MEMRA_STEP35_SWA_TKV --steps 24

Registered as `chunkinv35` (naked, assert invariant) and `chunkinv35c` (canary) in
`tools/fast-gate/models.tsv`; `tools/fast-gate/map.tsv` routes `hybrid_forward.rs` to both.

**Why a second arm rather than widening the existing `chunkinv`.** Two independent reasons the qwen
arm was blind here, both from the receipt:
1. Its pinned prompts are 96 and 147 tokens — **below** step35's 512 window — so every chunk took
   the same kernel and the gate compared one kernel against itself (GAP 2).
2. Its canary seam `MEMRA_PRIME_F32CHUNK0` is read in `full_attn_prime_fa_dispatch`, which step35
   never reaches (`full_attn_prime` diverts at `:1289`). The canary was **inert** on this arch
   (GAP 1). `MEMRA_STEP35_SWA_TKV` is the seam that arch actually needed.

The chunk set is not arbitrary: it spans both sides of the closed form — `4096,513` gave `P=0`,
`512,256` gave `P=512`, and `64` gave `P=512` via 77 chunks instead of 10. Pre-fix those families
agreed *within* and disagreed *across*; post-fix all five must be byte-identical, which is a
strictly stronger assertion than "some chunk sizes agree".

Script changes (`tools/chunk-invariance-gate.sh`): `--prompts` / `--seam` / `--label` so the
arch-specific arms share one script; per-label artifact resolution for the box-staged step37 GGUF
(`MEMRA_STEP37_GGUF` or `~/step37/...`) with a clean SKIP when absent (fast-gate reads the script's
own SKIP word — the hole that once reported `chunkinv` as "PASS (0s)" on a rig with no artifact);
and the summary-table grep now keys off the actual `--chunks` values, since the hardcoded
`2048|64|32` printed nothing on any other chunk set.

## 4. RESULTS — gate battery

Raw: `raw/gate35-20260806T235547Z.log`. One flock window from 23:55:47Z, cards 0 MiB at acquire.

### 4.1 `chunkinv35` — GREEN (this is the deliverable)

    label=step35-swa assert=invariant seam=MEMRA_STEP35_SWA_TKV legacy-seam=off got=invariant
    canary=0 chunks=4096,513,512,256,64  T=4883
        513 | EXACT | -1 | 0.000e0 | identical
        512 | EXACT | -1 | 0.000e0 | identical
        256 | EXACT | -1 | 0.000e0 | identical
         64 | EXACT | -1 | 0.000e0 | identical
    chunkinv verdict: CHUNK-INVARIANT — prefill logits bit-identical at every chunk size
    chunk-invariance-gate: PASS

Pre-fix this same invocation returned CHUNK-DEPENDENT with 512/256/64 all diverging.

### 4.2 `chunkinv35c` — canary has teeth, and it reproduces the finding lane's numbers exactly

    legacy-seam=on got=variant canary=1
        513 | EXACT  |  -1 | 0.000e0 | identical
        512 | DIFFER |   0 | 1.813e0 | step 6
        256 | DIFFER |   0 | 1.813e0 | step 6
         64 | DIFFER |   0 | 1.813e0 | step 6
    chunkinv verdict: *** CHUNK-DEPENDENT ***
    chunk-invariance-gate: PASS (canary broke the assertion as required — gate has teeth)

Two things worth stating plainly. First, the canary changes the **world**, not the label — the trap
documented in the gate script's header (a label-only canary is perfectly correlated with the default
gate and proves nothing). Second, the seam reproduces the receipt's numbers to the digit: maxdiff
`1.813e0`, `first_div_pos = 0`, greedy divergence at step 6, and `513` EXACT while `512` DIFFERs —
the one-token knife edge. That is independent confirmation that `MEMRA_STEP35_SWA_TKV` is a faithful
restoration of the pre-fix arithmetic and therefore a legitimate BEFORE arm for §5's perf work.

It also newly shows `256 | DIFFER`, which the finding lane measured only against `ref=512` (where it
was EXACT, `P` matching). Against `ref=4096` the closed form predicts DIFFER (`P=512` vs `P=0`) and
it does — a 14th arm-pair consistent with the model.

---

## 5. RESULTS — the finding lane's own falsification battery, re-run post-fix

Raw: `raw/battery35-20260807T001751Z.log`. One flock window 00:17:51Z -> 00:38:44Z (21 min), cards
0 MiB at release. `battery35.sh` re-runs the bodies of the finding lane's committed
`chunkinv-long.sh` and `chunkinv-knife.sh` against the fixed build, plus a wider boundary sweep and
the below-window control. The finding lane pre-registered four falsification predictions and hit
4/4; every one of them is now dead:

| arm | pre-fix (the receipt) | post-fix |
|---|---|---|
| LONG `prompt-pp6257` T=4883, chunks 4096,2048,512,64 | 512 and 64 **DIFFER**, maxdiff `1.813e0`, greedy step 6 | **all EXACT** (`-1`, `0.000e0`, identical) |
| KNIFE PRED-1+2 ref=4096 vs 513,512 (the one-token flip) | 513 EXACT, 512 **DIFFER** | **both EXACT** |
| KNIFE PRED-3+4 ref=512 vs 384,256 | 384 **DIFFER** @row 384, 256 EXACT | **both EXACT** |
| BOUNDARY T=4883, chunks 4096,1024,600,128,32,16 | `P` in {0,0,512,384,512,512} -> mixed | **all EXACT** |
| CONTROL T=402 (below the 512 window), chunks 4096,512,64,32 | all EXACT (nothing to break) | **all EXACT** — unchanged |

Every arm returns `chunkinv verdict: CHUNK-INVARIANT — prefill logits bit-identical at every chunk
size`, `rc=0`. The KNIFE arms matter most: they were built to be the sharpest possible probe of the
closed form (a **one-token** change in chunk size flipping the verdict, because `P` jumps 512 -> 0
between `c=512` and `c=513`). A fix that merely moved the boundary would still show a flip
somewhere in 384/512/513/600; none does. The T=402 control is the guard against the trivial way to
pass this battery — breaking prefill so badly that everything agrees on garbage: it exercises the
same code with `seq_end <= win` and is byte-identical to its pre-fix self.

---

## 6. RESULTS — exactness battery (BAR-2)

Raw: `raw/exact35-20260807T004546Z.log`. One flock window 00:45:46Z -> 00:47:22Z, cards 0/0 MiB at
release. Same `c809181d` binaries the gate and battery ran on (`BOX-COMMIT.txt`).

| gate | result |
|---|---|
| `kernel-check` model-backed on the step35 IQ4_XS artifact, FULL (no `MEMRA_KC_FAST` / `MEMRA_KC_ONLY`) | **`ALL GREEN: kernels match CPU reference.`** exit 0 |
| `run-gen` argmax, PP-2, ngen=64 | `prefill argmax=6776 decode argmax=6776 ... MATCH` + `batched-prime argmax=6776 tokenwise argmax=6776 MATCH`, exit 0 |
| `ppn-gate` stages=2 (this is the pair-topology receipt) | **`ppn gate PASS [serial]`** and **`PASS [pipelined]`**: 24 steps (8 prime + 16 gen) **BIT-IDENTICAL** logits vs the door-OFF reference, `n_vocab=128896`, `fence=[0, 22, 45]`, exit 0 |

`ppn-gate` is the load-bearing one here, and worth being precise about what it does and does not
cover. It asserts the PP-2 split path is bit-identical to the unsplit walk over the same sharded
placement, i.e. the fix did not perturb anything at the stage boundary (stage 0 = layers 0-21,
stage 1 = 22-44 — both stages carry SWA layers, so both run the changed arm). It runs 8 prime
tokens, so it does not itself cross the window; the window-crossing assertion is §4/§5's job.

The `kernel-check` run is model-backed on the SKU's own bytes: `iq4xs-mmq
[Step-3.7-flash-IQ4_XS-00001-of-00003.gguf token_embd.weight]` at T=16/64/128/512 all OK
(`rel<=2.04e-4`). The many `KC-SKIP [section] <other model>.gguf: absent on this box` lines are
this box holding only the step artifact — they are pre-existing coverage gaps of this *box*, not of
this change, and the arms they gate (qwen/gemma/ornith NVFP4, Q4_0, Q8_0) are covered on the 5090
in §7. Recorded rather than glossed because a reader counting green lines would otherwise
overcount.

### 6.1 q9/q35 unaffected (BAR-4)

Raw: `raw/unaffected-q9-q35-5090-20260807.log`. Local RTX 5090 Laptop, under
`systemd-run --scope -p CPUQuota=1200% -p MemoryMax=48G` with `flock /tmp/memra-gpu.lock` held
(desktop stays responsive; no uncapped saturation).

| check | result |
|---|---|
| qwen `chunkinv` (the pre-existing arm, default label/seam/prompts) | PASS — CHUNK-INVARIANT on both pinned prompts |
| qwen `chunkinvc` canary | PASS — still has teeth (64 DIFFER `5.269e-1`, 32 DIFFER `6.375e-1`) |
| `run-gen` q9 (Qwen3.5-9B-NVFP4-MTP) | `prefill argmax=271 decode argmax=271 MATCH`, `batched-prime MATCH`, pp89 2486.5 tok/s, decode 134.79 tok/s |
| `run-gen` q35 (Qwen3.6-35B-A3B IQ4_XS) | `prefill argmax=271 decode argmax=271 MATCH`, `batched-prime MATCH`, pp89 1693.3 tok/s, decode 180.73 tok/s |

Two independent reasons the other arches cannot move, and the receipts above are the belt to that
braces: (1) the predicate change lives inside `step35_attn_pre_wo`, reachable only through
`full_attn_prime`'s `self.cfg.step35.is_some()` divert at `:1289` — every other arch takes the
`full_attn_prime_fa_dispatch` path, untouched; (2) the only shared-path edit is threading one
`usize` argument, which no other arch reads. The qwen `chunkinv` pair also confirms the generalized
`chunk-invariance-gate.sh` (new `--label` / `--prompts` / `--seam` flags, rewritten summary grep)
did not break its original arm — the script change is as load-bearing as the engine change here.

---

## 7. RESULTS — prefill perf, before vs after (BAR-3)

Raw: `raw/perf35-20260807T004722Z.log`. **One flock window** 00:47:22Z -> 02:12:39Z (85 min), 30 arm
invocations, cards 0/0 MiB at release. Thermal regime: warm steady-state throughout — GPU 0 held
36-39 C at 2392-2400 MHz and GPU 1 32 C at 2325 MHz across the whole window (per-rep
`nvidia-smi` samples in the log), so no arm ran on a cold or throttled card.

**Instrument.** `concat-prime-probe ppprime`, which times `prime_cache` — the path this fix changes.
`run-gen`'s "prefill tok/s" line times `forward_last`, the **cacheless monolithic** path where
`seq_end == t` by construction, so it cannot see this change at all. Recorded so nobody
re-measures the wrong thing and concludes "no effect" from an instrument that is blind by design.

**Arms.** Same binary, one process per arm, strictly alternating AFTER/BEFORE (the repo's
interleaved law — cross-run and cross-day comparisons are clock-drift-invalid, including for a
self-comparison). AFTER = naked default (`seq_end` predicate, the shipped path). BEFORE =
`MEMRA_STEP35_SWA_TKV=1`, the rollback seam. The seam is a legitimate BEFORE arm because §4.2
showed it reproduces the pre-fix receipt's arithmetic to the digit; using it avoids a second build
of `c809181d^` and therefore avoids comparing two different compilations.

Each printed median is itself the median of 3 timed reps after 1 warmup, so each cell is
5 interleaved arm-medians per side (N=5 of the quantity compared), 15 timed primes per side.

| cell | arm | N | median | tok/s | within-arm spread | delta |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **pp6257 (T=4883) chunk=4096 — THE SHIPPED DEFAULT** | AFTER | 5 | 52.1910 s | **93.56** | 0.119% | **+0.009%** |
| | BEFORE | 5 | 52.1956 s | 93.55 | 0.181% | |
| pp6257 (T=4883) chunk=512 — where the fix changes an arm | AFTER | 5 | 45.4441 s | 107.45 | 0.268% | **-0.467%** |
| | BEFORE | 5 | 45.2320 s | 107.95 | 0.190% | |
| pp512 (T=402) chunk=4096 — null control, below the window | AFTER | 5 | 3.6498 s | 110.14 | 0.408% | **-0.093%** |
| | BEFORE | 5 | 3.6464 s | 110.25 | 0.255% | |

### Verdict against the BAR's stop condition

The bar was: *if the default moves >1%, STOP and report rather than ship.* **The default moved
+0.009%** — three orders of magnitude inside the threshold, and an order of magnitude below the
arms' own within-arm spread. The lane ships.

Read the null control first, because it calibrates everything above it. At T=402 the two arms are
**the same machine code taking the same branch** (`seq_end = t = 402 <= win`, so both predicates
evaluate false and select FA): the only honest expected delta is 0. It measured **-0.093%**. That
is this box's noise floor for this instrument, and it means a delta of a few tenths of a percent
carries no signal. The default cell's +0.009% is comfortably below even that.

The chunk=512 cell's -0.467% is the only delta larger than the null control, and it is the one cell
where the fix genuinely changes work: pre-fix, rows [0,512) took dequant-once FA; post-fix they take
the f32 windowed kernel, one chunk out of ten. It is a **non-default** configuration, it is still
half the STOP threshold, and it is only ~2.5x the null control's magnitude, so calling it "a real
0.47% cost" rather than "noise with a plausible story" would be over-reading three tenths of a
percent. What can be said without over-claiming: at the one chunk size where the fix does extra
work, the cost is bounded well under 1%, and it buys exactness.

§2.1's enumeration predicted the default's arm sequence is **identical** pre- and post-fix at every
T, hence a zero delta. That prediction is now confirmed on silicon rather than argued. The purpose
of a measurement whose result is known in advance is exactly this: it converts "the code should not
be able to move" into "the code did not move".

### Incidental finding, recorded not acted on

At T=4883 the **non-default** `MEMRA_PRIME_CHUNK=512` primes **14.8% faster** than the shipped
default 4096 (107.45 vs 93.56 tok/s, both AFTER arms, same window, same thermal state). That is a
prefill-tuning lead, not this lane's business: it is a *serving default* question that needs its own
sweep across T and its own memory-headroom accounting (the chunk default exists to bound per-layer
transient allocation — the long-ctx OOM fix), and changing it would be a board-moving change under
a different lane. Flagged here because the number was measured cleanly and would otherwise be lost;
this lane does not change the default.

## 8. RESULTS — run-spec K=1..8 (the third correctness gate)

Raw: `raw/spec35-20260807T005750Z.log` (window 02:12:39Z-02:20:04Z) and
`raw/spec35b-20260807T023100Z.log` (02:31:00Z-02:36:54Z). Drafter: the standalone
`Step3.7-flash-mtp-Q8_0.gguf` attached via `MEMRA_MTP_DRAFT` (the base shards declare
`nextn_predict_layers=0`, so the external-draft door is the only attach path on this SKU).

Why this is not covered by §6's argmax gate: `generate_spec` primes through `prime_cache` — the
changed path — and then feeds that KV to the draft head, so a prefill numeric change propagates into
the drafter's read set. `research/f8f4-flip-20260806` receipted exactly that: a change that moved
acceptance by -9.5pp while every self-consistency and golden probe stayed green. So **acceptance is
recorded alongside the PASS line**, not hidden behind it.

| arm | acceptance | self-consistency |
|---|---|---|
| **S1** K=1..8, n=32, short prompt (T=19) | K=1 14/18 = 77.8%; K=2..8 all 15 accepted (44.1% -> 11.0%) | `=== SELF-CONSISTENCY PASS ===`, identical to generate at every K |
| **S2a** K=3, n=32, long prompt T=4883, **default chunk** | 16/45 = 35.6% | PASS |
| **S2b** same, `MEMRA_STEP35_SWA_TKV=1` (BEFORE) | 16/45 = 35.6% | PASS |
| **S3a** K=3, n=32, T=4883, **`MEMRA_PRIME_CHUNK=512`** (AFTER) | **16/45 = 35.6%** | PASS |
| **S3b** same cell, BEFORE | **16/51 = 31.4%** | PASS |

S1 reproduces the pre-fix baseline (`raw/mtp-draft-20260806T215132Z.log`, the finding lane's own
run) **digit for digit** at all eight K values — same accepted counts, same drafted counts, same
percentages. That is the strongest statement available that the fix is inert on the short-prompt
regime: not "still passes", but "identical numbers".

S3 is the cell that justified running this at all, and it is worth being precise about why the first
pass nearly missed it. S2a/S2b compare AFTER vs BEFORE at the **default** chunk — where §2.1 says the
arm sequence is identical pre- and post-fix, so their agreement (16/45 both) confirms the default is
untouched but is **structurally incapable** of showing acceptance movement. Re-running the same
comparison at `MEMRA_PRIME_CHUNK=512`, where the fix genuinely changes an arm, does show it:
**BEFORE needed 51 drafted tokens to land 16 accepted; AFTER needed 45.** The number of *accepted*
tokens is identical (16) — which is why self-consistency and every greedy golden stay green in both
arms — while the *rounds* differ, exactly the signature f8f4-flip warned about.

And the direction is the point: post-fix, the chunk=512 run's acceptance (35.6%) is **identical to
the default chunk's** (35.6%), whereas pre-fix it was 31.4%. The fix does not merely leave spec
alone — it makes speculative acceptance chunk-invariant too, which is downstream evidence that the
prefill KV is now genuinely chunk-independent rather than merely producing chunk-independent

## 9. A SECOND segmentation axis, found while measuring — serve's per-tick `prime_cache` calls

**This is a residual defect of the same class, one level up. It is NOT fixed by this lane, and it is
not a regression this lane introduced — it predates the fix.** Recorded here with receipts because
finding it and hiding it in a summary would be worse than not finding it.

`chunkinv` and the fix both concern the split **inside one `prime_cache` call**. But serve does not
prime a long prompt in one call. `worker.rs:3551-3568` (and `prefill_tick` at `:3074-3115`) primes
**up to a per-tick budget per scheduler tick**, one `prime_cache` call each, so a long prompt is
segmented **twice**: once across calls, then again inside each call. Each call gets its own
`cache.pos`, hence its own `seq_end` — so the arm predicate is free to differ *between* calls even
though this lane made it fixed *within* one.

Budgets come from `LanePolicy::prefill_budget` (`crates/memra-lanes/src/lib.rs:118`):
`MEMRA_PREFILL_TICK=1024` (interactive), `MEMRA_PREFILL_JUDGE=MEMRA_PREFILL_HARVEST=256` (dark).

**Enumerated first** (`enum-tick-budget.py`, replicating the real loop incl. the `PRIME_MIN_T` tail
merge), then measured. Prediction stated before the run: budget >= 513 is byte-identical to a
monolithic prime at every T in [2,40000); budget <= 512 diverges at every T >= 513.

**Measured** — `raw/tickinv35-20260807T022010Z.log`, new `tickinv` probe mode, PP-2, one flock
window 02:20:12Z-02:30:36Z:

| arm | budget | calls | logits | maxdiff | greedy |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| A: T=4883 (past win) | 1024 | 5 | EXACT | 0.000e0 | identical |
| | 513 | 10 | EXACT | 0.000e0 | identical |
| | 512 | 10 | **DIFFER** | 1.813e0 | **step 6** |
| | 256 | 20 | **DIFFER** | 1.813e0 | **step 6** |
| | 64 | 77 | **DIFFER** | 1.813e0 | **step 6** |
| B: CONTROL T=402 (below win) | 1024 / 256 / 64 | 1 / 2 / 7 | EXACT | 0.000e0 | identical |
| C: T=4883 nested, `MEMRA_PRIME_CHUNK=64` | 1024 | 5 | EXACT | 0.000e0 | identical |
| | 256 | 20 | **DIFFER** | 1.813e0 | **step 6** |

The enumeration was exactly right, including the 512/513 boundary. Note the divergence signature:
maxdiff `1.813e0`, first diverging row 0, greedy split at step 6 — **the same numbers as the
original defect** (§1, §4.2), which is the strongest possible evidence it is the same mechanism
reached through a different door rather than a new one. Arm C also shows the two axes are
independent: the inner split is invariant (that is the fix) while the outer one is not.

### What this does and does not mean for the shipped serve config

- **Interactive lane: not exposed via the tick budget.** Default 1024 > 512, measured EXACT.
- **Dark lanes (judge/harvest): exposed.** Default 256, measured DIFFER. Worse, `worker.rs:2113`
  caps dark budgets by `adaptive_cap = headroom_ms * prime_tok_per_ms`, i.e. the effective budget is
  a function of *live SLO headroom* — so on a loaded box the dark-lane segmentation is not merely
  small, it is **load-dependent**, and two identical judge requests can be primed differently.
- **The interactive lane IS still exposed by a different door:** the prefix-cache LCP split. With
  `snapshot_at = L` set, chunks stop exactly at `L` (`worker.rs:3092-3110`) so the first call ends at
  `L` regardless of budget; `PREFIX_CACHE_MIN_TOKENS=64` and `win=512` mean **any LCP landing in
  [64, 512] reproduces the FA-prefix shape** on an interactive request. Enumerated: 1347 (T,L) pairs
  over T in {600,1024,4883}, up to 512 FA rows.

### Why this lane does not fix it here

The obvious fix is to thread the *request's* total prompt length rather than the call's, but
`prime_cache`'s public contract is per-call (its own doc comment defines continuation priming as
"a NEW SUFFIX onto a live session cache"), so the correct fix changes an engine **API** and touches
every caller — engine, server, spec, probes. That is a different change class from this lane's
one-predicate fix, it needs its own before/after numbers, and merging it into a lane whose whole
claim is "cannot move the default" would destroy that claim. The honest deliverable is: this axis is
now **named, enumerated, measured, and reproducible on demand** (`tickinv`), with the exposure
mapped per lane. A follow-up lane owns the fix.

What this lane's fix *does* still buy, unchanged by the above: `MEMRA_PRIME_CHUNK` — the knob
`docs/FLAGS.md` invites an operator to set per rig — is now a pure memory knob on step35, and every
single-call prefill (`run-gen`, `run-spec`, the probes, and interactive serve at the default tick
budget) is chunk-invariant.

### Why `tickinv` is NOT registered as a fast-gate arm (yet)

Deliberate, and the same call the finding lane made about `chunkinv35`: a gate that asserts
tick-invariance would be **legitimately red today**, and landing a known-red check trains everyone
to ignore red. The rule this lane followed for its own gate — *the assertion ships green, in the
same commit as the fix that makes it green* — applies to the follow-up lane too. `tickinv` exists in
the probe binary, is documented in the probe's header, and its arms are scripted in `tickinv35.sh`,
so the follow-up lane starts with the instrument and the receipt already built; registering it in
`tools/fast-gate/models.tsv` is that lane's first commit, not this one's.

## 10. Deliverable summary

| BAR item | status |
|---|---|
| 1. Implement on `lane/step35-chunkfix` off `origin/restructure/public-split` | done, `c809181d` |
| 2. red `chunkinv35` gate goes GREEN | **GREEN** (§4.1), canary has teeth (§4.2) |
| 2. finding lane's falsification battery returns EXACT everywhere | **4/4 predictions dead** (§5) |
| 2. `run-gen` argmax MATCH | **MATCH** (§6) |
| 2. `kernel-check` ALL GREEN | **ALL GREEN**, model-backed on the SKU's bytes (§6) |
| 2. `ppn-gate` still bit-identical | **PASS serial + pipelined** (§6) |
| 3. before/after prefill perf, N>=5 interleaved, same lock hold | done (§7); **default +0.009%**, null control -0.093% |
| 3. STOP if the default moves >1% | not triggered — 0.009% is ~100x inside the bar |
| 4. q27/q9 unaffected | q9 + q35 argmax MATCH on the 5090, qwen `chunkinv` + canary PASS (§6.1); path is `cfg.step35.is_some()`-scoped by construction |
| extra | `run-spec` K=1..8 PASS, acceptance now chunk-invariant too (§8) |
| extra | second segmentation axis named, enumerated, measured, scoped to a follow-up lane (§9) |

**Ship verdict: the fix is correct, gated, and free at the shipped default.** The one thing a
reader should carry away beyond the green ticks is §9: `MEMRA_PRIME_CHUNK` is now a pure memory knob
on step35, but the *tick-budget* axis above it still steers arithmetic on the dark lanes and via the
prefix-cache LCP split, and that is unfixed.
