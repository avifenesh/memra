# Traffic-shaped mixed artifact — Sbox, 2026-07-11

This is the promoted follow-up built from the corrected non-REAP routing trace. Selection used no
public-evaluation data. Experts are ranked independently inside each of the 79 MoE layers by router
selection count, with ascending expert ID as the deterministic tie-break.

| Per-layer rank | Encoding | Experts/layer | Layer-expert slots | Projections | Expert bytes | Cumulative routing traffic |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 1–16 | Q8_0 | 16 | 1,264 | 3,792 | 25,348,276,224 | 22.3201% |
| 17–53 | NVFP4 | 37 | 2,923 | 8,769 | 31,032,999,936 | 49.8495% |
| 54–126 | Q2_K | 73 | 5,767 | 17,301 | 35,715,907,584 | 84.9830% |
| 127–192 | pruned | 66 | 5,214 | 0 | 0 | 100.0000% |

The expert overlay is **92,097,183,744 bytes (85.772 GiB)**. Adding the same
24,999,514,624-byte non-expert payload used by every arm gives **117,096,698,368 logical bytes
(109.055 GiB)**. This is 37.06% smaller than `plain_quant` and 2.01% smaller than
`mix_quant_prune25`. Logical size describes the shared body plus sparse expert overlay; a later
standalone GGUF export can differ because of container metadata and common-tensor encoding.

The early N=1 directional screen scored 2/7 and justified building this artifact. The abandoned
N=50 and LIMIT=6 runs are not evidence and must not resume. The valid capability screen is the
locked 56-question `hourish-v1-0aecb65-20260711T091032Z` run; its result remains pending while this
evidence is recorded.

## Fixed-slot cache penalty observed during the hourish screen

The matched hourish server loaded this artifact with 10,886 cache slots because the current cache
sizes every slot for the largest expert projection. For this artifact the projection sizes are:

| Encoding | Projection bytes | Projections |
|---|---:|---:|
| Q8_0 | 6,684,672 | 3,792 |
| NVFP4 | 3,538,944 | 8,769 |
| Q2_K | 2,064,384 | 17,301 |

The fixed-slot byte budget is 72,769,339,392 bytes (`10,886 * 6,684,672`). The actual mean across
the 29,862 retained projections is 3,084,092.95 bytes. At the same byte budget, an ideal
size-aware allocation can therefore hold about 23,595 projection slots: a **116.75% capacity
increase** before allocator metadata and class-fragmentation costs.

The first HumanEval request took 204.79 seconds. Its server snapshot reported 68.681% cache hits,
313,250 explicit reads, 944,811,933,696 staged bytes, zero read errors, and zero short reads. This
does not affect the locked quality result, but it makes size-classed fixed-address cache allocation
the direct performance follow-up if this policy passes the capability gate. Do not change the
pinned runtime during the matched screen.
