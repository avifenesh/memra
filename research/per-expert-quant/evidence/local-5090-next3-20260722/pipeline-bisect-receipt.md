# 2026-07-22 gate + bisect: io/compute pipeline chain — flat e2e, mechanism fully attributed

Target: local RTX 5090 laptop, Hy3 Layer-103.5 dual-NVMe profile, 45-token chat prompt, N=32
post-freeze greedy decode, cooled 55-56 °C starts, GPU/load contamination guards. Candidate
companion = async read pipeline + paired IQ3_S/Q4_K AVX-VNNI kernels + thread-local scratch
pooling (branch `hy3-10toks`); control = merged main companion
(`26303685576126a829933144be6af7dad6a6c19995b0b90421ca196d47c31621`).

## Measurement chain (all runs in this directory)

| arm | tok/s | phase_compute | exposed io (companion) | verdict |
|---|---|---:|---:|---|
| control ×5 (pairs + anchors + probe) | 4.55 4.50 4.77 4.46 4.48 → median 4.50 | 3.0–3.2 s | 2.85–2.94 s | clean band |
| candidate, passive waits ×4 | 2.86–3.05 → ~2.9 | **8.3–8.7 s** | 0.11–0.24 s | −36%: io fully hidden but compute tripled |
| candidate + io on E-cores ×2 | 2.97 2.98 | 8.6 s | 0.6 s | core placement irrelevant |
| candidate + `OMP_WAIT_POLICY=passive` | 3.00 | 8.4 s | 0.2 s | spin-policy-alone not the fix |
| candidate + `PIPELINE=0` (serial) ×2 | 4.63 4.09 | 2.98/3.52 s | n/a | kernels+pooling exonerated |
| candidate + ACTIVE spin + E-core io ×3 | 4.70 4.47 4.55 → median 4.55 | 2.72–2.99 s | 1.92–2.17 s | band recovered; **e2e flat vs control** |
| + engine core-0 reservation (7 threads) ×2 | 3.93 4.66 | — | — | no rescue; engine threads float |

Ruled out with direct measurement: core preemption (involuntary context switches 61k→3.8k in
the E-core arm with no speedup), OMP spin policy alone, package power collapse (P-core clocks
sag ≤10%, `freq-*.txt`), and DMA/memory interference (cache-hot compute bench unchanged beside
two full-rate O_DIRECT streams).

## Mechanism (confirmed)

1. The pipeline's consumer loop inserts cv-wait gaps between many small OMP regions. With
   default passive waits, workers sleep at each gap; every ready-batch region entry pays a
   futex + C-state cold wake, ~10k times per 32-token window → compute 3.0 → 8.4 s.
2. `OMP_WAIT_POLICY=ACTIVE` removes the wakes (compute 2.7 s, better than control), but the
   workers then spin between companion calls and starve the caller: Rust-side
   `exposed_wait` (5.7–6.1 s) exceeds companion `backend_wall` (5.0–5.1 s) — impossible
   without caller starvation. The 1.2 s the companion saves, the spinners take back.
3. Per-call overlap ceiling is also structural: a call's missing experts cannot overlap
   their own reads, so only ~0.8 s of the 2.9 s io hides under cached-expert compute.
   Hiding the rest needs cross-call prefetch (the owner's prediction lead) or fewer bytes
   (HBM residency donors).

## Decisions

- `BW24_CPU_EXPERT_PIPELINE` becomes **opt-in** (companion default off). Callers without the
  launcher's `OMP_WAIT_POLICY=ACTIVE` would silently hit the −36% passive regression.
- The Hy3 launcher opts in (`PIPELINE=1`, `ACTIVE`, io pool on E-cores 8–15): best measured
  median (4.55 vs 4.50), statistically flat, and it keeps the prefetch scaffold exercised.
- Paired IQ3_S/Q4_K kernels + scratch pooling ship unconditionally: bit-identical, micro
  −26.6%/−16.9%, e2e-neutral at the current io-bound balance (stage counters 2.7–3.0 vs
  3.0–3.2 s), zero flag surface.
- Next lever, in order: single-region-per-call restructure (waits inside the region — removes
  the wait-policy dependence and the caller starvation), then HBM residency donors
  (KV fp8/fp4 + `VRAM_FRAC`), then cross-call prefetch on the pipeline scaffold.

Correctness this session: post-freeze argmax `40129 == 40129` MATCH on every scored arm,
run-spec K=1..8 self-consistency PASS (candidate), `kernel-check` ALL GREEN, perf-ci quick
0 fail. Anomaly noted: `spin-arm-3` froze 9,050 CPU-routed experts vs 8,809 elsewhere
(profile-admit timing sensitivity) — its 4.55 slightly understates that arm.
Non-scoring contended runs quarantined under `premature-migration-window/`.

## Addendum — the shipped winner (same day, `v2-*`/`final-*`/`v4` logs)

Two earlier probe rounds (`pool-*`, `stage-pipe-stage`) ran a stale binary: the buffer-pool
commit did not compile (nested-class NSDMI made the deleter non-default-constructible) and
the build script's exit status went unchecked. Those rounds are void. After the fix:

| arm (serial io, pipeline off) | runs | median |
|---|---|---:|
| control (merged main companion) | 4.55 4.50 4.77 4.46 4.48 | 4.50 |
| + paired kernels + scratch pooling + RawBlockPool buffer recycling | 4.92 4.72 4.67 | **4.72** |
| + 2 MB-aligned blocks with `MADV_HUGEPAGE` | 4.84 4.80 | **4.82** (N=2) |

Decode-window compute: control 3.0–3.2 s → pool 2.63–2.99 s → THP 2.76–2.85 s; unchanged
io volume; argmax MATCH on every run. Net **+7% e2e** over the same-day control band and
+4.8% over the 2026-07-21 4.60 receipt, from CPU-side memory-system work only.

## Addendum 2 — persistent shm cache pair (`warm-cold.log` / `warm-warm.log`)

`BW24_CPU_EXPERT_CACHE_SHM=1` cold→warm restart pair on the full model: the warm process
reopened 6,701 entries (17.149 GB) with zero refill reads for the reloaded set, argmax MATCH
both runs. Honest read: under the freeze protocol the decode windows are state-identical by
construction (same frozen residency and cache: hits/misses/fills equal), so the 4.66 vs 4.91
tok/s delta is run variance, not a claimable win; and whole-run NVMe reads fell only 3.3 GB
of 227.9 GB because the 128-token warmup flood streams far past the cache and evicts most of
the warm head before it pays. The feature's value is the restart PROPERTY (instant warm
cache, zero refill for the retained set) — converting it into wall-clock requires the next
increment: persist the freeze/residency profile alongside the index and skip the warmup
phase entirely on a clean warm reopen. Startup wall (~7:45) is dominated by GPU-side HBM
staging (~412 GB spill-worker reads), a separate lever.

Stage-split instrumentation on the pipelined path localized its inflation inside the
worksharing compute loops of both cached and missing subsets (entry/wait/accumulation
innocent), with the serial path fast under the identical region structure — consistent with
concurrent-DMA fabric interference (snoop/invalidation traffic across the rotating buffer
space). The planned `IO_THREADS=1` trickle-DMA confirmation run was lost to a host
interruption and has not been obtained; the interference mechanism is the surviving
explanation, not a confirmed one. The pipeline scaffold (IoPool, per-expert readiness,
single-region wait) stays in the tree behind the opt-in flag for the cross-call prefetch
lane, which does not require full-rate concurrency.
