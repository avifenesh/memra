# pp2spec-crash — task #87: the sticky ILLEGAL_ADDRESS under spec+PP-2 concurrency

**Lane**: `lane/pp2spec-crash` off `006aca75`. **Rig**: <keypair>, 2x RTX PRO 6000
Blackwell Server 96GB, sm_120a, CUDA 13.2, driver 595.71.05 (SPOT box, shared, flock
GPU-lock discipline). Model: q9 = Qwen3.5-9B-NVFP4-MTP GGUF on box NVMe.

**Inherited finding** (lane/pp2-spec, merged 5882b753): spec over `MEMRA_PP_DEVICES=1,0`
loses 100% of requests at c=4 (0/48, 3/3 reps), the fault is STICKY (every later
new_session in the process inherits `CUDA_ERROR_ILLEGAL_ADDRESS`), spec-OFF same placement
is 96/96 clean, and `MEMRA_SPEC_NOGRAPH=1` fails identically (draft graph exonerated).
Quarantined at parse time via `DraftVerdict::RefuseSpecOverPp2`.

## Diagnostic door

The quarantine walls off the debugger too, so commit 3f56c8ce adds
`MEMRA_PP2SPEC_UNQUARANTINE=1` — skips both refusal sites (preflight + load-path verdict),
WARNs loudly at boot, dies with the quarantine when #87 is fixed. Since the finding lane,
the spec-gate (#89) also merged: at c>=4 it routes new arrivals to batched decode, which
would HIDE the two-live-spec-sessions trigger — every repro arm therefore pins
`MEMRA_SPEC_GATE=0`.

## Round 1 — repro + first localization (raw/round1/, box receipts ~/receipts/pp2crash)

Three phases, one script (`raw/round1/run-pp2crash-repro2.sh`), tree @ 3f56c8ce:

| phase | env delta | c=2 | c=4 | verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A bare | (none) | 1/8 ok | 0/16 ok, wall 0.070s | **REPRODUCES** |
| L launch-blocking | `CUDA_LAUNCH_BLOCKING=1` | 12/12 ok | 16/16 ok | **CLEAN** |
| B memcheck | compute-sanitizer memcheck + `MEMRA_SPEC_NOGRAPH=1` | 8/8 ok | 8/8 ok | **CLEAN, 0 findings** |

Phase A quotes (raw/round1/A-server.log):

    [worker] spec pool evicted (2) after alloc failure; retrying (evict-first learned)
    [worker] spec session alloc failed (DriverError(CUDA_ERROR_ILLEGAL_ADDRESS, "an illegal
             memory access was encountered")); tokenwise path

then the sticky repeat for every later request — same signature as the finding lane, 3/3
faithful. Client-side (A-points.jsonl): c=2 errors are `step error: ILLEGAL_ADDRESS` and
`cache alloc failed: ILLEGAL_ADDRESS`; c=4 is all `cache alloc failed` in 70 ms = context
dead on arrival.

**The kernel-level fault is captured this time** (raw/round1/xid-at-fault.log, journalctl
at 06:07:02 = the exact A-phase c=2 fault minute):

    NVRM: Xid (PCI:0000:32:00): 31, pid=112468, name=memra-gpu-worke, channel 0x00000002,
    intr 00000000. MMU Fault: ENGINE GRAPHICS GPC0 GPCCLIENT_T1_1 faulted @ 0x484_c6b3c000.
    Fault is of type FAULT_PDE ACCESS_TYPE_VIRT_READ

PCI 32:00 = **GPU index 0 = stage 1** (placement dev10: stage0=dev1, stage1=dev0). A
VIRT_READ FAULT_PDE = a kernel READ through an unmapped page-directory entry — a stale or
never-mapped device pointer, not an out-of-bounds offset within a live allocation
(memcheck's specialty, consistent with B finding nothing).

## What round 1 establishes (quoted, not inferred)

1. **Timing-dependent, not a logic bug in the math**: `CUDA_LAUNCH_BLOCKING=1` (every
   launch synchronous) is 28/28 clean; the sanitizer's serialization also masks it. The
   race window needs genuinely-async cross-stream execution. This KILLS the "padded
   side-tensor corrupts KV slot ownership" shape (SGLang #33253) as primary — that class
   is timing-independent and would fault under L too.
2. **The faulting access is a READ on the stage-1 device (dev0) through an unmapped PDE.**
   Consistent with a use-after-free (stream-ordered free retired the mapping while another
   stream's kernel still read it) or a pointer to another device's memory dereferenced
   without peer mapping. The TRT-LLM #16170 relay-starvation analogue (stale/reused
   boundary pointer while the owner thread blocks) remains live; so does a WAR/RAW hazard
   on a shared buffer between two spec sessions' interleaved bursts (SGLang #33587 shape).
3. **Two live spec sessions on the split ARE the trigger** (re-confirmed): c=2 lost 7/8 in
   phase A while c=1 and every spec-OFF arm in the record are clean.
4. Sanitizer note: the 36 `Program hit CUDA_ERROR_NOT_FOUND ... cuModuleGetFunction`
   records in B-server-sanitizer.log are the engine's known fallible symbol probe
   (`Engine::func` tries 5 modules in sequence, lib.rs:1123-1131) — benign, present in
   every clean run.

## Round 2 — the faulting kernel is NAMED (raw/round2/)

Coredump-on-exception preserves async timing until the trap. Two data points:

- **Phase C** (coredump env, c=4 only, NO c=2 warmup phase): 16/16 CLEAN — the trigger
  wants the c=2+warmup arrival pattern; raw c=4 on a fresh server didn't fire this time.
- **Phase D** (coredump env, exact phase-A sequence): c=2 1/8, c=4 0/16 — the A signature,
  and the driver caught the trap. `cuda-gdb` on `core-r1-125335.nvcudmp`
  (raw/round2/D-cudagdb-core-r1-125335.log), quoted:

      CUDA Exception: Warp MMU Fault
      The exception was triggered at PC 0x7c986b7ad960  embed_gather_u32
      #0  0x00007c986b7ad9f0 in embed_gather_u32<<<(16,1,1),(256,1,1)>>> ()
      [device 0, sm 0, warp 5, lane 0]

  Registers R10/R11 = 0x484_c6b3c500 — the SAME PAGE as round 1's Xid 31
  (`faulted @ 0x484_c6b3c000`). A reproducible fault VA across independent runs is a
  pointer-valued read of a stale/unmapped mapping, not a random-offset overrun.

`embed_gather_u32` at grid (16,1,1) = the T=1 single-token gather (n_embd 4096 / 256).
In the spec serving path that shape is the DRAFT CHAIN's first node.

## Round 3 — both draft arms fault at the SAME VA (raw/round3/)

Two arms, exact-A sequence, coredump env, fresh server each (`run-pp2crash-round3.sh`):

| arm | draft path | c=2 / c=4 | faulting kernel | fault VA (R10:R11) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| nograph (`MEMRA_SPEC_NOGRAPH=1`) | eager chain | 1/8, 0/16 | `embed_gather_u32_t` (grid 16,1,1) | 0x484_c6b3c500 |
| graph2 (default) | captured graph replay | 1/8, 0/16 | `embed_gather_u32` (grid 16,1,1) | 0x484_c6b3c500 |

Same fault VA in three independent server processes, two different kernels, both being
the draft chain's embed gather (eager arm: `mtp_head_forward_dev` op A
`embed_gather_device_t(g, &[e_tok], ..)` spec.rs:735; graph arm: `mtp_head_forward_cap`
`embed_gather_device` spec.rs:1281). Both kernels read exactly two device buffers: the
resident embed TABLE (`model.embd_gpu`, a per-model `OnceLock` uploaded once) and the
tiny token-id buffer. The token-id buffers differ per arm (fresh `htod_u32_v` vs the
session's persistent `g_tok`) — but the fault VA is IDENTICAL across arms and processes,
so the common operand — **the resident embed table pointer** — is the stale mapping.
(An identical VA also kills "garbage token index": a wild index would fault at
table_base + garbage*row_bytes, different every time.)

Working hypothesis, to be settled by operand readout (round 4): the embed table is
uploaded through the PRIMARY engine's stream (dev0-homed under placement 1,0 — note the
primary is stage 1 here) via `embd_gpu.get_or_init(|| e.upload_u8(..))`, while a second
live spec session's traffic runs concurrently; the table allocation lands in the async
pool and something stream-ordered frees or remaps that VA range. Candidate mechanisms to
discriminate: (a) the upload races a pool free from another session's dropped transients
(alloc reuse across streams without dependency — pool has REUSE_ALLOW_OPPORTUNISTIC=0,
INTERNAL_DEPENDENCIES=1, but those govern ONE device's pool and same-pool reuse only);
(b) the table OnceLock is initialized by a different Engine (stage engine vs primary) in
one session and dereferenced under the other stage's context.

## The SENTINEL-TOKEN arithmetic (the round-3 VA decoded)

The q9 artifact's `token_embd.weight` is NVFP4 (`ggml_dtype 40`), dims [4096, 248320]
(read off the GGUF header on-box). NVFP4 block = 64 elems -> 36 bytes, so
`row_bytes = 4096/64*36 = 2304`. The device argmax kernels (`argmax_partial_f32` /
`argmax_final_f32`, kernels.cu:122/161) initialize `best_i = 0x7fffffff` and only replace
it when a comparison WINS — if every logit is NaN (`v > best_v` false, `v == best_v`
false), the sentinel survives and `token_out[0] = 0x7FFFFFFF`. And:

    0x4_C6B3_CE00 + 0x7FFFFFFF * 2304 = 0x484_C6B3_C500  (the fault VA, exactly)

i.e. the fault VA IS `embd_base + 0x7fffffff * row_bytes` for a table based at
0x4C6B3CE00 — a plausible dev0 async-pool VA, and the SAME across processes because the
pool's VA reservation is deterministic at equal load points. Both draft arms read the
argmax output as the next chain token (graph: in-graph argmax -> `g_tok` -> next replay's
embed; eager: `argmax_token_device` -> `tok_d` -> `embed_gather_device_t`), so ONE
all-NaN draft-head logits row poisons the chain's next embed lookup identically in both
arms. This also explains stickiness (the MMU fault kills the context) and why
launch-blocking/sanitizer mask it (the NaN producer is a cross-stream race that
serialization removes).

What makes the logits NaN is now the question — h_seed (the verify's hidden handed to the
draft chain, produced INSIDE the stage-split verify and published via `publish_to`) is
the leading candidate operand; a WAR/UAF on spec scratch between two concurrent sessions
is the leading mechanism class.

## Round 4 — aborted (box contention)

The first FULL-coredump attempt timed out on the GPU flock (a co-tenant lane held a
long window: `probe-pp2-valley.sh`). Re-dispatched as round 5 with a 4h flock wait.

## Round 5 — operand readout blocked; EVT escape hatch is itself broken under PP-2 (raw/round5/)

- **G** (full coredump): reproduced (same `embed_gather_u32`, grid 13073, dev0), but
  cuda-gdb cannot read param memory even from the full dump
  (`CUDBG_ERROR_INVALID_MEMORY_ACCESS` on every `@parameter` read — the param-space
  readout appears broken for this driver/dump combination, it misattributes the param
  window to `fa_decode_vec_q_rows_v4_512_tb`), and global probes of the predicted table
  base come back `Cannot access memory`. Operand-level confirmation via the dump is a
  dead end on this toolchain; the VA arithmetic (exact to the byte, three processes)
  stands as the evidence.
- **H** (`MEMRA_EVT=1` x2): INSTANT hard failure, 0/8 at c=2 INCLUDING the solo warmup,
  wall 0.03s, quoted: `step error: DriverError(CUDA_ERROR_INVALID_CONTEXT, ...)`. No
  illegal address anywhere. The cross-stream event-tracking escape hatch is INCOMPATIBLE
  with the ppN multi-context runtime (cudarc records events in one context and waits on
  them in another) — the probe is INCONCLUSIVE for the race question, and the flag is a
  landmine for any future PP-2 debugging (documented here so nobody burns a day on it).

### The mechanism, restated precisely

The MMU fault needs NO stale mapping: `0x7FFFFFFF * 2304 = ~4.6 TB` past the table base
— a VA that was never mapped. The whole crash is: **draft-head logits row reads as
all-NaN under 2+ concurrent spec sessions over the PP-2 split; the device argmax's
sentinel (0x7FFFFFFF) survives every NaN comparison; both draft arms feed that token id
straight into the next chain step's embed gather; the gather dereferences
table+sentinel*row_bytes; MMU fault; context dies.** c=1 never trips because the NaN
producer needs a second session's interleaved GPU work.

Localization to the DRAFT chain (not the verify) is pinned by the faulting kernels:
sentinel-fed `embed_gather_u32{,_t}` at T=1/grid-16 exist only in the draft chain; a
verify-side sentinel would fault the T=K+1 gather (`embed_gather_device_td`) or panic
the d2t map indexing first.

## Round 6 — the traps fired, and they change the game (raw/round6/)

Four sentinel traps landed (32d86e21: greedy graph, sampled graph, eager chain, verify
accept walk — each refuses `idx >= vocab` with quoted NaN counts instead of feeding
0x7FFFFFFF into `embed_row()`). Trap build, exact-A x3 reps:

| rep | c=2 | c=4 | recovery (c=1 x4 after) |
|---|---|---|---|
| T1 | 7/8 | **16/16** | 4/4 |
| T2 | 7/8 | **16/16** | 4/4 |
| T3 | 7/8 | **16/16** | 4/4 |

The trap line, quoted (identical in all three reps):

    step error: draft(graph) argmax sentinel 0x7fffffff >= d_vocab 248320 at round 0
    j=0 pos=296: round-seed NaN 4096/4096 — refusing to dereference the embed row (#87 trap)

What this establishes:

1. **The NaN theory is CONFIRMED at the operand level**: the draft-graph seed buffer
   read back 4096/4096 NaN — the ENTIRE [n_embd] hidden is NaN, round 0, j=0.
2. **Stickiness is architecturally gone with the trap in place**: one request errors
   (7/8 at c=2), everything else — including the previously-100%-fatal c=4 phase —
   serves. 48/48 requests after the trap vs 0/48 in the finding lane. The MMU fault WAS
   the whole process-killing mechanism; refusing the dereference contains the blast to
   the one poisoned burst.
3. `round 0, j=0, pos=296`: the poison arrives with the FIRST chain step of a burst —
   the seed was NaN BEFORE any drafting. The seed at round 0 comes from the pre-loop
   init: `decode_step_h(last_token)` (the INIT FEED, spec.rs:3750) or a continuation's
   carried `last_h`/`prompt_h` tail — all products of the STAGE-SPLIT trunk walk
   (`decode_step_h_ppn` / `prime_cache`) handed across streams.
4. 7/8+16/16 serving at a c=4 that used to be 0/48 ALSO means: with the fault contained,
   spec+PP-2 concurrency fundamentally works — the remaining bug is "one burst's
   entry hidden is NaN under concurrent session traffic", a much smaller animal.

Refined trap (746a14ea) re-running: g_seed (self-fed = head OUTPUT at j) vs h_seed_buf
(round INPUT, untouched since round-start copy) — discriminates poisoned-arrival from
head-compute-NaN. j=0 with g_seed=NaN could still be either (the replay had already run).

## Round 6b — the dual-seed trap names the producer side (raw/round6b/)

Same battery on 746a14ea, quoted (T1/T2; T3 differs in one number):

    step error: draft(graph) argmax sentinel 0x7fffffff >= d_vocab 248320 at round 0 j=0
    pos=296: head-out NaN 4096/4096, round-input-seed NaN 13/4096 — refusing ... (#87 trap)

    (T3: head-out NaN 4096/4096, round-input-seed NaN 0/4096)

**The round INPUT seed is the poisoned buffer — with a PARTIAL, random-looking NaN count.**
13/4096 is the uninitialized/garbage-bits signature (P(NaN | random u32) ~ 1/256 ->
E[NaN] ~ 16 of 4096), not a compute overflow (which gives 0 or ~all). One norm over a
garbage row spreads it: head-out 4096/4096. T3's 0/4096 re-read is the smoking gun for a
READ-BEFORE-WRITE race: the DRAFT GRAPH read the buffer while garbage, the trap's host
re-read (microseconds later, after the error sync) saw it already written clean.

h_seed_buf at round 0 = `e.clone_dtod(h_seed0)` + prompt_h/continuation overwrite —
device-to-device copies on the PRIMARY stream from buffers produced by the STAGE-SPLIT
trunk (`decode_step_h_ppn` h_seed / `prime_cache` hiddens). The dtod reads its source
BEFORE the producer wrote it — or reads a pool block whose previous owner's free-reuse
raced — exactly the class `publish_to` fixed for the verify EXIT, one seam over.

## Round 7 — ROOT CAUSE + FIX: reverse publication (raw/round7/)

`publish_to` orders caller reads behind stage compute. NOTHING ordered the reverse:
stage-allocated buffers (verify logits/hidden, ckpt stashes) drop with `free_async` on
the ALLOCATING stage stream while the primary stream still holds queued reads of them
(cudarc `Drop`: with event tracking elided there is no read-guard, and the pool's
internal-dependency reuse orders only against the FREE). The next burst's stage-stream
allocations reuse those blocks and their writes race the queued primary reads. c>=2
gates it because a second session's interleaved burst is what enqueues reusing stage
work while the first session's commit reads are still queued.

Fix (7450928b + 4c72d637): `PpNRt::fence_stages_behind(caller)` — one event on the
caller's stream, every stage stream waits it — at the entry of all three ppN bodies
(verify, eager, batched). Door-shut configs never build a PpNRt: single-card untouched.

Verdict battery on 7450928b (raw/round7/, x3 exact-A reps + one long gate):

| arm | result |
|---|---|
| X1/X2/X3 c=2 (the trigger) | 7/8+16/16 x3, ZERO trap lines, ZERO illegal |
| XG crash gate c=4 x100 | **100/100**, agg 112.4 tok/s |
| XG crash gate c=8 x104 | **104/104**, agg 111.5 tok/s |

(The 1 err per c=2 rep in X1-X3 was the WARMUP-phase trap on the pre-fence binary's
leftover... no — X ran ON the fence binary; the 1 err is the c=2 phase's single
trap-refused request from the UNFENCED eager/batched bodies still in 7450928b. 4c72d637
fenced those too; the full gate battery re-runs the sequence on it.)

Wait — correction, quoted from X-points.jsonl: X1-c2 errors_sample shows the SAME
`draft(graph) ... head-out NaN 4096/4096, round-input-seed NaN 13/4096` trap. So on
7450928b (verify-body fence only) the c=2 trigger still fired ONCE per rep via a path
the verify fence does not cover — consistent with the INIT FEED (`decode_step_h` ->
`decode_step_h_ppn`, the eager body) producing h_seed0. 4c72d637 fences the eager and
batched bodies; the running gate battery is the verdict.

## Gate battery on 4c72d637 (raw/gates-4c/) — one residual left

ppspec bit-identity 0 failing arms (dev01/dev10/singledev + batched pp), run-spec K=1..8
SELF-CONSISTENCY PASS both placements with acceptance counts IDENTICAL to door-shut
(27/36, 33/62, 36/84 ... 36/224 — same table all four logs), kernel-check ALL GREEN,
run-gen MATCH, crash gate c=4 100/100 + c=8 104/104, door-shut smoke 16/16 spec-live at
548 tok/s. Residual: gate-c2 7/8 — exactly ONE admission-collision trap per c=2 storm,
still `round 0 ... input-seed NaN 13/4096`. The one stage-stream allocation site outside
the step bodies is the NEW session's stage-owned KV (`pp::new_cache` -> `Cache::new_ppn`
alloc_zeros on stage streams): its pool blocks can be reuse of a victim's still-queued
reads. Admission fence landed (80b2ddf4).

## FINAL battery on 80b2ddf4 (raw/gates-final/) — ALL BARS GREEN

| bar | verdict |
|---|---|
| crash gate c=2 (the trigger sequence) | **8/8** (residual closed) |
| crash gate c=4 x100 | **100/100**, agg 112.2 tok/s |
| crash gate c=8 x104 | **104/104**, agg 111.8 tok/s |
| ppspec bit-identity (dev01/dev10/singledev) | 0 failing arms x3 |
| batched pp bit-identity (dev01) | 0 failing arms |
| run-spec K=1..8 over PP-2 (both placements) | SELF-CONSISTENCY PASS, acceptance == door-shut |
| kernel-check | ALL GREEN |
| run-gen naked | MATCH |
| door-shut spec serve smoke c=4 | 16/16, spec-acc live, 548 tok/s |

(The battery script's own "failures: 1" is its grep matching the diagnostic door's WARN
banner, which contains the string "ILLEGAL_ADDRESS" — the server log has no fault line.)

212/212 requests at c=2..8 on the placement whose baseline was 0/48-and-dead.

## THE ROOT CAUSE, one paragraph

`publish_to` (2026-08-06) ordered caller READS behind stage COMPUTE at the verify exit.
Nothing ordered the REVERSE: buffers allocated on a stage stream (verify logits/hidden,
ckpt stashes, and at admission the new session's stage-owned KV) drop with `free_async`
on the ALLOCATING stage stream while the PRIMARY stream still holds queued reads of them
— with decode-path event tracking elided (the 2026-07-05 default), the drop carries no
read-guard, the idle stage stream retires the free immediately, and the async pool's
internal-dependency reuse orders only against the FREE. The next burst's (or the next
admitted session's) stage-stream allocations then write into blocks the queued primary
reads have not consumed: the spec round seed reads random bits (13/4096 NaN — the
uninitialized-bits signature; clean on host re-read microseconds later), one norm spreads
it to a 4096/4096-NaN head-logits row, the device argmax's 0x7FFFFFFF init sentinel
survives every NaN comparison, and the next chain step's embed gather dereferences
`table + 0x7FFFFFFF*2304` = ~4.6 TB past the table — Xid 31 MMU FAULT_PDE, sticky
context death. c=1 is clean because one session's round loop syncs before its own next
round; c>=2 interleaves a second session's stage work into the victim's queued-read
window.

## Fix inventory (all on lane/pp2spec-crash)

- `PpNRt::fence_stages_behind(caller)` — one event on the caller's stream, every stage
  stream waits it — at the entry of `decode_step_t_core_ppn` (7450928b),
  `decode_step_h_ppn` + `decode_step_batch_ppn` (4c72d637), and `pp::new_cache`'s
  stage-KV admission path (80b2ddf4). Door-shut configs never build a PpNRt.
- Sentinel traps (32d86e21, 746a14ea): every device-argmax token readback refuses
  `idx >= vocab` with quoted NaN counts instead of dereferencing — correctness armor
  that also turns any future recurrence into a diagnosis line instead of a dead context.
- `#87 CLOSED` (c41dc345): `RefuseSpecOverPp2`, the parse-time preflight, the load-path
  refusal, and the `MEMRA_PP2SPEC_UNQUARANTINE` diagnostic door all removed; docs
  (FLAGS.md `MEMRA_SERVE_SPEC` + `MEMRA_MTP_DRAFT`, DRAFT-REGIME.md) flipped to lifted,
  with the dev01 ~20x placement-perf note kept (a scheduling property, not a crash).

## Quarantine-lifted perf (raw/perf/) — N=5 interleaved (c=1: N=3), dev10, fixed binary

**Naked boot proof**: the quarantine-removed binary boots `MEMRA_PP_STAGES=2
MEMRA_PP_DEVICES=1,0` + embedded-MTP q9 with NO override env (the variable no longer
exists), serves 16/16 at c=4, `[spec-acc]` lines live, zero illegal/sentinel lines.

| arm | c=1 | c=2 | c=4 |
|---|---|---|---|
| S: spec ON (`MEMRA_SPEC_GATE=0`, pure spec path) | 112.5 | 112.3 | 112.1 |
| N: spec OFF (batched plain) | 223.3 | 340.3 | 593.4 |

(agg tok/s, medians; spreads < 1 tok/s on every cell — the arms are stable.)

The concurrency-gated spec scheduler's (#89) premise HOLDS on PP-2 — with a twist: on
THIS placement spec-ON never wins, even at c=1 (112 vs 223). The spec-scaling law
reproduces (S flat 112.5 -> 112.1 across 4x load: the serial-burst queue shape; N scales
2.7x), but the door-shut c=1 spec WIN (253 vs 139 on single-card, research/spec-scaling)
does not transfer to dev10 PP-2 at these settings. So the CRASH is fixed and the gate's
demote-at-c>=4 policy is directionally right on PP-2; whether spec-ON should engage at
all on this placement is a PERF question for the spec-gate/placement lane (T_LOW=0 for
PP-2, or a placement-aware gate), not a correctness one. #89's default gate (LOW=2,
HIGH=4) already keeps c>=4 traffic off the spec path; the c<=2 window on PP-2 leaves
~2-3x on the table until that tuning happens — flagged, not silently shipped.

## Known non-blockers, recorded

- `MEMRA_EVT=1` (cudarc event-tracking escape hatch) is INCOMPATIBLE with the ppN
  multi-context runtime: instant `CUDA_ERROR_INVALID_CONTEXT` on the first request
  (raw/round5/H*). Pre-existing; the flag predates ppN. Do not debug PP-2 with it.
- dev01 (stage0=dev0) spec-ON remains ~20x slow per the 2026-08-06 perf table — a
  separate placement-scheduling question, never part of the crash.
- cuda-gdb `@parameter` reads fail on this driver/dump combo (round 5) — use the
  in-binary traps for operand forensics on this box, not the dump.
