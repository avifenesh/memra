# TTFT anatomy and kill - 2026-08-08

## Verdict

The TTFT performance targets pass on the integrated PP-2 train:

- 228-token short turn: **0.589 s p50**, N=8 (target <0.8 s).
- 4107-token rendered 4k turn: **5.992 s p50**, N=5 (target <=7.5 s).

The lane's final blocker is resolved and the branch is **releasable**. The two
session-affinity failures were a smoke-harness precondition bug, not a product regression:
the PP-2 placement default disables spec admission, so the old arm could not create the parked
spec session that owns affinity rewind. Check 10 now forces the documented always-spec seam
for its two servers only. The full PP-2 `serve-smoke` rerun ended with `0 failed`, with three
rewinds in each affinity arm and no failed restore.

## Rig and protocol

The requested box2 address was unavailable: SSH timed out and the cloud inventory observed during
the run showed `darklanes-sprint-pair2` terminated; the final recheck no longer listed it.
Measurements therefore used the designated fallback box1, the same `sbox-2card` PP-2 class,
at `<rented-box-ip>`.

- GPUs: 2x NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell Server Edition, PP devices `0,1`.
- Model: Step-3.7-Flash IQ4_XS shards plus the external Q8_0 MTP draft.
- Serving measurements: spec off, sequential requests, unique cache namespaces, one excluded
  warmup, then N=8 short and N=5 4k.
- Every accepted run began with 0 MiB GPU memory used. Thermal start/end values and binary/model
  hashes are in each `summary.log`.
- Prompt file SHA-256:
  `23c1d8384a16c7c0bcb7736b412d43e64c0b4d8e238703864e928565f824ae11`.

## Phase anatomy

All values below are p50 milliseconds. `first SSE` is the handoff from first decoded token to the
first serialized SSE `data:` frame; keepalive comments are excluded.

### Before the solo-prefill fix (`c5e26522`)

| shape | N | client TTFT | parse | admission | queue | tokenize | prime wait | prime | decode wait | first SSE | server total |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| short, 228 tok | 8 | 588.116 | 0.013 | 0.011 | 0.033 | 0.662 | 5.500 | 581.471 | 0.135 | 0.023 | 587.929 |
| 4k, 4107 tok | 5 | 7117.664 | 0.044 | 0.014 | 0.037 | 8.882 | 1.178 | 7107.127 | 0.135 | 0.027 | 7117.486 |

The suspected fixed serve-layer cost is not present on the current train. Excluding prime,
server work is 6.458 ms on the short request and 10.359 ms on 4k. Queue wait is 0.033-0.037 ms,
and first-SSE handoff is 0.023-0.027 ms. Prime compute owns 98.9% of short server TTFT and
99.9% of 4k server TTFT.

### Causal controls

| arm | short TTFT | short prime | 4k TTFT | 4k prime | conclusion |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| grouped default, tick 1024 | 588.116 | 581.471 | 7117.664 | 7107.127 | integrated baseline |
| `MEMRA_MOE_GROUPED=0` | 934.811 | 928.069 | 10855.249 | 10844.910 | serve is using Lever C; rollback costs 0.347 s short / 3.738 s 4k |
| `MEMRA_PREFILL_TICK=8192` | 589.722 | 582.774 | 5995.418 | 5985.078 | remaining 4k loss is outer 1024-token call segmentation |

Lever C is live in serving. The remaining divergence from the standalone grouped-prefill rate was
four scheduler-level `prime_cache` calls, each choosing geometry from its 1024-token slice. One
outer call restores the engine's eight-microbatch geometry and reaches 686 tok/s over the rendered
4107-token prompt.

## Fix

Commit `c09afe4c` widens only a naked, sole, fresh interactive request to one bounded outer
prefill call of at most 8192 tokens. It does not widen when another unfinished session or queued
request exists. An explicit `MEMRA_PREFILL_TICK` remains authoritative, and concurrent sessions
retain the existing 1024-token fairness cap. A remainder below `PRIME_MIN_T` is merged rather
than stranded on tokenwise prefill.

### After (`c09afe4c`)

| shape | N | client TTFT | parse | admission | queue | tokenize | prime wait | prime | decode wait | first SSE | server total |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| short, 228 tok | 8 | 589.238 | 0.015 | 0.012 | 0.045 | 0.694 | 5.743 | 582.295 | 0.136 | 0.029 | 589.053 |
| 4k, 4107 tok | 5 | 5991.509 | 0.051 | 0.019 | 0.044 | 8.769 | 1.078 | 5981.119 | 0.141 | 0.039 | 5991.215 |

| shape | before p50 | after p50 | delta | target | result |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| short | 0.588 s | 0.589 s | +0.001 s | <0.8 s | PASS |
| 4k | 7.118 s | 5.992 s | -1.126 s (-15.8%) | <=7.5 s | PASS |

## Gates

| gate | verdict |
|---|---|
| local `memra-server` unit suite | 122 passed, 0 failed |
| model-backed `kernel-check` | ALL GREEN |
| PP-2 `run-gen` | prefill/decode and batched-prime/tokenwise argmax 6776 MATCH |
| PP-2 `run-spec` K=1..8 | 8/8 self-consistency PASS; pinned acceptance pattern retained |
| `serve-smoke` | **PASS: 0 failed**; record/replay arms each logged 3 affinity rewinds |
| affinity liveness teeth | **PASS**; forced-spec PP-2 with `MEMRA_AFFINITY=0` had live spec work and 0 rewinds, reproducing the arm's expected RED condition |
| overall | **PASS — releasable** |

## Serve-smoke blocker resolution

The failing arm printed:

```text
FAIL: replay arm never rewound — only one arm exercised the resume path
FAIL: affinity never rewound — the resume path was not exercised
```

Both rewind counters were actually zero. The retained server log explains why:

```text
[spec-gate] policy placement=pp2-cross-device LOW=0 HIGH=1 source=placement-default spec-admission=off
```

With no spec session to park, later turns used prefix-cache hits and the affinity probe never
ran. This was not caused by the solo-prefill change:

- PP-2's `LOW=0` policy landed in `0ddff8f4`, already an ancestor of `c09afe4c^`.
- `c09afe4c` did not change `tools/serve-smoke.sh` or the affinity/spec engine code.
- Its widened prefill loop explicitly skips `s.spec.is_some()` sessions, so it cannot alter
  affinity rewind behavior.

The harness fix exports `MEMRA_SPEC_GATE=0` around check 10 and unsets it afterward. On the
same `c09afe4c` binary and PP-2 placement, the full battery then passed with three explicit
rewinds in both arms. The teeth control kept forced spec but set `MEMRA_AFFINITY=0`: the log
contained cross-device transport plus six `[spec-acc]` rows, zero rewinds, and the expected
`affinity never rewound` failure condition. The arm therefore remains able to catch an inert
affinity path.
