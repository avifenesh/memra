# lane/tick-seg — kill the SECOND prefill segmentation axis on step35 (serve's per-tick prime_cache calls)

**Mission:** the first axis (MEMRA_PRIME_CHUNK, inside one `prime_cache` call) died in
lane/step35-chunkfix (commit `c809181d`, merged `006aca75`): the SWA arm predicate is keyed on
`seq_end = cache.pos + t`, computed once per CALL. But serve primes a long prompt across SEVERAL
`prime_cache` calls — one per scheduler tick — and each call gets its own `cache.pos`, hence its
own `seq_end`. The predicate is fixed *within* a call and free *between* calls. This lane makes
`prime_cache` see the REQUEST-level seq_end regardless of tick splits.

**Defect receipt (prior lane's, do not re-derive):**
`research/step35-chunkfix-20260807/PROGRESS.md` §9 + `raw/tickinv35-20260807T022010Z.log`.
tickinv probe (concat_prime_probe.rs `"tickinv"` mode, ~line 1031): T=4883, budgets
1024/513 EXACT; 512/256/64 DIFFER maxdiff `1.813e0`, first_div_row 0, greedy step 6 — the SAME
signature as the original chunk defect (same mechanism, one level up). Control T=402 all EXACT.
Nested arm (budget x MEMRA_PRIME_CHUNK=64): inner axis invariant, outer not — axes independent.

**Exposure map (from §9):**
- Interactive lane: MEMRA_PREFILL_TICK=1024 > 512 => not exposed via budget.
- Dark lanes (judge/harvest): MEMRA_PREFILL_JUDGE/HARVEST=256 => EXPOSED; worse, worker.rs:2113
  caps dark budgets by live SLO headroom => LOAD-DEPENDENT segmentation.
- Interactive IS exposed via the prefix-cache LCP split: `snapshot_at = L` stops the first call
  exactly at L (worker.rs:3092-3110 region; prefill_tick bound_rem logic ~worker.rs:3488-3506);
  any LCP in [64, 512] reproduces the FA-prefix shape (PREFIX_CACHE_MIN_TOKENS=64, win=512).

**Upstream precedent (vLLM #51113, research/upstream-sweeps.md 08-07 section at train tip
9fae6a6c — NOT in this branch's history, read via `git show 9fae6a6c:research/upstream-sweeps.md`
lines 328-345, 531-537):** mamba align-chunking prefix-cache poisoning — mid-block chunk end
published as full block; single requests accidentally safe. Two laws the fix must satisfy:
(1) position-keyed state publishes only at grain-aligned ends — only the FINAL chunk of a request
may end unaligned; (2) unaligned STARTS (resume-from-cache at off-grid position) are a second
hole => this lane adds an off-grid-resume gate arm (prime from a prefix-cache hit at LCP in
[64,512], verify bit-identity vs monolithic).

## Code map (verified in this worktree at 006aca75)

- `prime_cache`: `crates/memra-engine/src/hybrid_forward.rs:407`. Computes
  `let seq_end = cache.pos + t;` at :465, threads to `prime_chunk(.., seq_end)` (:544) ->
  `full_attn_prime(.., seq_end)` (:1305, step35 divert at :1311) -> `step35_attn_prime` (:6960)
  -> `step35_attn_pre_wo` (:6829). Predicate at :6884-6891:
  `MEMRA_STEP35_SWA_TKV=1 ? t_kv > win : seq_end > win` (rollback seam, canary teeth).
- Cacheless path: `step35_attn` (:6944) passes `t` with
  `debug_assert_eq!(seq_end, t)` at :6921. `prime_chunk_captured` (:876) same.
- `prime_cache_batch` (:978): REFUSES step35 (`cfg.step35.is_some()` -> Err at :995). So the
  worker's batched-prime paths (worker.rs:2303, :2544) cannot carry step35 — per-tick single
  `prime_cache` is the only serve prefill for the SKU.
- Serve per-tick callers (the fix's targets):
  - `prefill_tick` worker.rs:3470-3532; prime call :3508. Budget from `LanePolicy::prefill_budget`
    (`crates/memra-lanes/src/lib.rs:118`); dark budgets SLO-capped at worker.rs:2113.
  - `step_session` prefill phase worker.rs:3941-3968; prime call :3954 (budget PREFILL_TICK_T).
  - LCP split: `snapshot_at` computed ~:2992-3046, bound_rem chunk-stop in prefill_tick
    :3488-3506, `prefix_insert_from_session` at :3523-3526.
- Engine-side non-tick callers (single call = whole request; seq_end already right):
  decode.rs:2105,:2349; spec.rs:3456; gemma_spec.rs:651; dflash.rs:553; ~15 bins incl.
  run_gen.rs, prime_batch_gate.rs (prefix+suffix two-call pattern — NOTE: that's a
  resume-style caller too), concat_prime_probe.rs (tickinv arm loop :1058 is the replica).
- tickinv probe mode: `crates/memra-engine/src/bin/concat_prime_probe.rs:1031-1105`. Replicates
  worker tick loop incl. PRIME_MIN_T tail merge; budget 0 = monolithic ref.
- Box scripts to reuse: `research/step35-chunkfix-20260807/{tickinv35,gate35,exact35,perf35,
  spec35,battery35}.sh`; box state `~/STATE-chunkfix.md` on `ubuntu@<rented-box-ip>`
  (key ~/.ssh/<keypair>.pem), artifact `~/step37/models/step-3.7-flash/IQ4_XS/`,
  flock /tmp/memra-gpu.lock, PP-2 = `MEMRA_PP_STAGES=2 MEMRA_PP_DEVICES=0,1`.

## Fast-gate registration shape (from chunkinv35, models.tsv:96-97 + map.tsv:77)

`tools/fast-gate/models.tsv` `kind=cmd` rows; fast-gate.sh reads a `SKIP` word from the script's
output for missing artifacts (fast-gate.sh:174-180). chunkinv35 rows call
`tools/chunk-invariance-gate.sh --label step35-swa --prompts .../prompt-pp6257.txt
--chunks 4096,513,512,256,64 --seam MEMRA_STEP35_SWA_TKV --steps 24` (+ `--canary` twin).
map.tsv:77 routes `hybrid_forward.rs` (+decode/pp/etc) to the arm list. Plan: a new
`tools/tick-invariance-gate.sh` (same self-gating shape, resolves the step37 artifact per-label,
SKIPs clean when absent) wrapping the probe's `tickinv` mode with budgets `0,1024,513,512,256,64`
+ an off-grid-resume arm; registered as `tickinv35` (+ `tickinv35c` canary via the
MEMRA_STEP35_SWA_TKV... NO — the canary seam for the OUTER axis must break tick-splits, see Fix
plan below; seam choice recorded there). map.tsv must route BOTH hybrid_forward.rs and
memra-server/src/worker.rs to the arm.

## Fix plan (sketch, pre-implementation)

The per-call `seq_end = cache.pos + t` is correct only when the call IS the whole request. The
request-level quantity must survive tick splits. Options considered:

A. **Change `prime_cache` API**: `prime_cache(e, tokens, cache, seq_end: usize)` where seq_end =
   the REQUEST's absolute end. Every caller passes it; single-call callers pass
   `cache.pos + tokens.len()` (their request == call). Mechanical but touches ~60 call sites,
   most of which would pass the degenerate value — high churn, low information.
B. **Carry it on the Cache**: `cache.prime_target: Option<usize>` set once by the serve loop at
   request admission (cache.pos + full_prompt_len), consumed/validated by prime_cache; None =>
   per-call seq_end (today's behavior, correct for single-call users). Risk: stateful, silent
   if a caller forgets to clear it.
C. **API with explicit request extent, default-correct**: keep `prime_cache` but add
   `prime_cache_to(e, tokens, cache, req_end)` — thin wrapper both serve call sites use;
   `prime_cache` delegates with `req_end = cache.pos + t`. Only ~4 sites change (2 worker ticks +
   probe replica + prime_batch_gate resume pattern), every other caller stays byte-identical by
   construction.

The brief says "fix changes prime_cache's per-call API and every caller" — decision recorded
after reading how gemma4/e4b paths interact (they divert before seq_end exists today; their
gates prove byte-identity). Non-step35 arches ignore seq_end entirely (only
step35_attn_pre_wo reads it) => byte-identity elsewhere is by construction, gates confirm.

Canary/teeth for the new gate: the tick axis has no dedicated seam yet. The old-world behavior
(per-call seq_end) must be restorable to give the gate teeth: plan is
`MEMRA_STEP35_PRIME_CALLLOCAL=1` (name TBD at implementation) restoring per-call seq_end
inside prime_cache — chunk/tick-variant by construction. Flags doctrine: rollback seam,
documented in docs/FLAGS.md.

Off-grid-resume arm: two-call prime (call 1 = L tokens, call 2 = rest) with L in [64,512] —
exactly the prefix-cache LCP shape — must be bit-identical to monolithic. The tickinv probe's
budget loop already produces unaligned starts (call 2 starts at pos=budget); a dedicated
`--split L` arm (or reusing budgets that hit L) makes the resume hole explicit.

## Deliverables checklist

- [x] Commit 1: PROGRESS.md (ae8e3616) — context anchor against restart churn.
- [x] Commit 2: tickinv35/tickinv35c registered (bd7c2c30) — tools/tick-invariance-gate.sh,
      models.tsv rows, map.tsv routes hybrid_forward-class AND memra-server; probe grew
      --splits (off-grid-resume arms, rows `sp<L>`). RED at registration by construction.
- [x] Commit 3: the fix (6b535472) — `prime_cache(e, tokens, cache, queued_after)`;
      seq_end = cache.pos + t + queued_after computed once; worker prefill_tick + step_session
      pass prefill_queue.len() post-drain; all ~60 single-shot callers pass 0; probe's tickinv
      replica passes t-fed-take. Seam MEMRA_PRIME_CALLLOCAL=1 restores per-call value
      (docs/FLAGS.md cataloged). Workspace builds clean.
- [x] Commit 4: ppprime --budget (cbf4a7d0) — times the serve-shaped multi-call prime.
- [x] Box scripts (3544fba5): gate-tickseg.sh / exact-tickseg.sh / perf-tickseg.sh.

      Pre-fix 512/256/64 DIFFERed 1.813e0.
      **tickinv35c canary HAS TEETH** — seam on: 1024/513 EXACT, 512/256/64 DIFFER 1.813e0 at
      greedy step 6 (the finding lane's receipt digit-for-digit — the seam is a faithful
      pre-fix restoration, hence a legitimate perf BEFORE arm), and the split arms give the
      FIRST MEASURED receipt of the LCP-split exposure (prior lane only enumerated it):
      sp64 DIFFER 1.735e0 @ step 10, sp256 1.594e0 @ step 6, sp512 1.813e0 @ step 6 — every
      LCP class in [64,512] steers the served text pre-fix.
      **chunkinv35 no-regress PASS + chunkinv35c teeth intact** — axis 1 undisturbed by the

      **8/8 SELF-CONSISTENCY PASS**, acceptance digit-identical to the chunkfix baseline
      (K=1 14/18=77.8%; K=2..8 all 15 accepted, 44.1%->11.0%) — the fix is inert on the
      single-call spec path, receipted not asserted.

      GREEN, tier 1 **0 fail** — 12 PASS including sstress (c=64 concurrency, the worker.rs
      edit's dedicated arm), accept, q35spec/g31spec; the 4 step35 arms SKIP cleanly (artifact
      box-staged), proving the SKIP word survives the dispatcher end-to-end.
- [x] serve-smoke on the 5090 (raw/servesmoke-5090-20260807T124017Z.log): **0 failed** — the

## Perf — before/after on the serve-shaped prime, N=5 interleaved, one lock hold

One flock window 12:14:24Z -> 13:36:13Z (82 min), 30 arm invocations, cards 0 MiB at release.
Thermal regime: warm steady-state — GPU0 35-40 C at 2400-2407 MHz, GPU1 32 C at 2325 MHz across
the whole window (per-rep nvidia-smi samples in the log); no arm ran cold or throttled.

**Instrument:** `concat-prime-probe ppprime --budget B` — times the worker-replica multi-call
prime, the exact path the fix changes. Monolithic ppprime and run-gen's prefill line are blind
to a multi-call change by construction (recorded so nobody re-measures the wrong thing).
**Arms:** same binary, one process per arm, strictly alternating AFTER (naked default,
request-level seq_end) / BEFORE (`MEMRA_PRIME_CALLLOCAL=1` — §gate battery proved the seam
reproduces the pre-fix arithmetic digit-for-digit, so it is a true BEFORE without a second
build). Each printed median = median of 3 timed reps after 1 warmup; each cell = 5 interleaved
arm-medians per side (N=5 of the compared quantity, 15 timed primes per side).

| cell | arm | N | median | tok/s | within-arm spread | delta |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **pp6257 (T=4883) budget=1024 — THE SHIPPED INTERACTIVE DEFAULT** | AFTER | 5 | 43.5225 s | 112.20 | 0.975% | **+0.068%** |
| | BEFORE | 5 | 43.4928 s | 112.30 | 0.783% | |
| pp6257 (T=4883) budget=256 — dark-lane default, where the fix changes arms | AFTER | 5 | 47.7224 s | 102.30 | 0.212% | **+0.374%** |
| | BEFORE | 5 | 47.5444 s | 102.70 | 0.223% | |
| pp512 (T=402) budget=1024 — null control, below the window | AFTER | 5 | 3.6580 s | 109.90 | 0.139% | **-0.008%** |
| | BEFORE | 5 | 3.6583 s | 109.90 | 0.407% | |

### Verdict against the STOP bar

The bar: *if the shipped default moves >1%, STOP and report rather than ship.* **The default
moved +0.068%** — 15x inside the bar, and an order of magnitude below the cell's own within-arm
spread (0.78-0.98%). The lane ships.

Read the null control first: at T=402 both arms are the same machine code taking the same
branch (seq_end <= win either way, single call, queued_after=0), honest expected delta 0 —
measured **-0.008%**, this instrument's noise floor on this box. The default cell's +0.068% is
well within its own spread and carries no signal.

The budget=256 cell is the one place the fix does real extra work: pre-fix, the first two
256-token calls' rows rode FA (per-call seq_end = 256/512 <= win); post-fix every call of the
T=4883 request takes the windowed arm. Cost: **+0.374%** on the DARK-LANE (non-interactive)
path — a third of the STOP bar, ~2.5x the prior lane's chunk=512 analog (-0.467% there,
+0.374% here, both bounded well under 1%), and it buys the judge/harvest lanes deterministic
arithmetic under load. Also visible in the absolute numbers: budget=256 primes ~9% slower than
budget=1024 in BOTH arms — the per-call overhead of 20 calls vs 5, pre-existing and
fix-independent (the interleaving isolates it away from the delta).

Enumeration predicted the interactive default could not move (budget 1024 > win means every
call's per-call seq_end already exceeded 512, so the arm sequence is identical pre/post); the
measurement converts "cannot move" into "did not move".

## Why the fix is correct-by-construction (not a tolerance argument)

Identical in kind to the chunkfix lane's §2 argument, one level up. The request's absolute end
position is a property of the REQUEST; `queued_after` merely restores information the caller
always had and the engine structurally lacked. For any segmentation of the same request,
`cache.pos + t + queued_after` is the same constant at every call, so step35's arm predicate
evaluates identically wherever the tick boundaries fall — including the LCP-split boundary
(bound_rem only shortens a tick's take; the remainder stays in prefill_queue, so the worker's
post-drain `prefill_queue.len()` is exact at the split too) and an off-grid RESUME (call 2's
`cache.pos = L` plus its own t and remainder still sums to the same request end).

Why nothing else can move:
- Only `step35_attn_pre_wo` reads `seq_end`; every other arch's dispatch never sees it. The
  5090 control (q9/q35) and the box exactness battery prove this on silicon, not just by
  construction.
- Every single-call caller passes `queued_after=0`, making `seq_end = cache.pos + t` — the
  pre-fix expression exactly. Those paths are byte-identical by substitution: same value, same
  arithmetic (run-gen argmax 6776 unchanged from the chunkfix lane's receipt confirms it).
- SESSION CONTINUATIONS (a new user turn on a live cache) pass 0 deliberately: a new turn is a
  new request whose arithmetic keys to its own extent. This preserves the existing serve
  contract (spec-session turns, kv-reuse resumes) — the fix changes only how ONE request's
  own segmentation is expressed, never how requests compose.
- The smem ceiling argument transfers: the arm only flips FA->naive_w on chunks whose t_kv <=
  win+chunk (the windowed floor's t_kv = win-1+t <= 12287 constraint is per-CALL geometry,
  untouched by where seq_end comes from).

## Residual found while fixing (NOT fixed here, named for the record)

**step35 prefix-cache entries are EXTENT-CLASSED.** Keying the SWA arm on the request's extent
(seq_end) makes the arm — and therefore the numeric class of every hidden row, and therefore the
KV BYTES appended at layers > 0 — a function of the request's total length. Two requests sharing
a >= 64-token prefix but straddling the window (creator seq_end <= 512 = FA class, consumer
seq_end > 512 = windowed class, or vice versa) will produce different prefix KV bytes. A
prefix-cache RESUME therefore continues from bytes of the creator's class, and can differ from a
cold prime of the same prompt — exactly vLLM #51113's cache-entry-side law ("state snapshot keyed
by position may only be published at grain-aligned ends" — here the state is additionally keyed
by the creator's extent, which position-keying cannot see). This is currently INSIDE the
documented contract (worker.rs prefix-seed comment: "the entry stores whatever config ran"), and
the same class of cold-vs-resume divergence already exists engine-wide for session continuations.
The canonical fix is ONE numeric class for all step35 SWA prefill rows regardless of extent
(always-windowed; the mask is a causal no-op for seq_end <= win) — a default-path perf trade on
every short interactive prompt, i.e. its own measured lane, not a rider on this one. What THIS
lane guarantees: a single request is bit-identical under every segmentation serve can produce
(tick budgets, SLO-capped budgets, LCP splits, off-grid resumes of its own prefix).

## Deliverable summary

| BAR item | status |
|---|---|
| 1. tickinv registered as fast-gate arm (first commit, red) | done — bd7c2c30 (`tickinv35`/`tickinv35c`, tools/tick-invariance-gate.sh, map routes hybrid_forward-class + memra-server) |
| 2. fix: request-level seq_end survives tick splits, API + every caller | done — 6b535472 (`prime_cache(.., queued_after)`; worker passes prefill_queue.len(); ~60 single-shot callers pass 0) |
| 2. off-grid-resume arm (vLLM #51113 second law) | done — probe `--splits`, arms sp64/sp256/sp512 in the registered gate |
| 3. tickinv all budgets EXACT on the pair box | **GREEN** — 1024/513/512/256/64 + sp64/sp256/sp512 all EXACT (was RED: 512/256/64 DIFFER 1.813e0) |
| 3. canary teeth | **PASS** — seam restores the receipt digit-for-digit; splits give the FIRST MEASURED LCP receipts (1.735/1.594/1.813) |
| 3. chunkinv35 no-regression | **PASS** + its canary intact |
| 3. kernel-check / run-gen / ppn-gate / run-spec on box | ALL GREEN / argmax 6776 MATCH PP-2 / BIT-IDENTICAL serial+pipelined / K=1..8 8/8 PASS, acceptance digit-identical to baseline |
| 3. unaffected-arch control | 5090: qwen chunkinv+canary PASS, q9 tickinv EXACT, q9/q35 argmax MATCH; plus change-scoped fast-gate tier1 0 fail (incl. sstress c=64) and serve-smoke 0 failed |
| 4. perf N=5 interleaved, STOP bar 1% on the default | **+0.068%** (default), +0.374% (dark-lane 256), -0.008% (null) — not triggered, ships |
| 5. evidence | all raw logs in raw/ (incl. per-probe tables pulled off box /tmp before spot reclaim); every claim receipted |

**What a reader should carry away:** serve can no longer steer step35's prefill arithmetic by
HOW it segments a request — tick budgets, SLO-capped dark budgets, LCP splits, and off-grid
resumes are all bit-identical to a monolithic prime, gated in both directions. The residual
worth knowing is the extent-class prefix-cache note above (creator-extent-keyed KV bytes,
inside the documented contract, canonical fix = one numeric class — its own measured lane).
