# M2 ppN — N-stage pipeline parallel on the 8xH100 box (2026-08-02)

Box: darklanes capacity block, rentedbox-48xlarge (8xH100 SXM, NVSwitch all-pairs P2P), window
2026-08-02T11:30Z → 2026-08-03T11:30Z. Repo `~/memra` @ lane/m2-pp8 (source commit
`a70a13c2` + this session's fixes, synced file-level; box tree is not a git checkout).
Model under gate/bench: Qwen3.5-9B-Q8_0 (q9), gemma-4-12b q4_0 (g12) for the serial arm.

**Scope shipped this window:** M2 increments 1–3 — PpNRt N-stage generalization (N up to
8), per-stage weight sharding (`MEMRA_PP_DEVICES` + sharded loader, `MEMRA_PP_SHARD=0`
rollback), deferred-readback pipelining (`decode_step_h_ppn_deferred` → `PendingLogits`).
**Microbatch (batch>1 through the pp pipeline) has no implementation in this lane — there
is no arm to gate; it is the explicit next increment,** not a silent omission.

## Verdict summary (final build, battery 3, 16:30–16:56Z)

`run-m2-gates.sh` (this dir): **28/28 verdict lines PASS, script-detected failures: 0.**

| gate | configs | verdict |
|---|---|---|
| ppn-gate q9 serial | N=2/4/8 × {singledev, dev0..N-1} × {shard, noshard} + asym splits 5,16,27 + split5 + overlap + streams0 | **PASS — BIT-IDENTICAL, 48 steps, all 13 arms** |
| ppn-gate q9 pipelined (deferred, window 3, overlap forced) | same minus streams0 (serial-only by design, note printed) | **PASS — BIT-IDENTICAL, all 11 arms in battery 3** (but see the standing-race section: a battery-5 dev01 flake makes the honest cross-device record ~69/70) |
| ppn-gate g12 serial (gemma4 arm, N=2) | singledev + dev01 | **PASS — BIT-IDENTICAL** |
| pp2-gate legacy (M1 binary semantics) | singledev + dev01 | **PASS — BIT-IDENTICAL** |
| pp-transport-smoke | 8 devices, all 56 peer pairs `cuDeviceCanAccessPeer=1` | **PASS** |
| kernel-check | full battery | **ALL GREEN: kernels match CPU reference** (0 FAIL lines) |
| run-gen naked | q9 + g12 | **argmax MATCH both** (door shut untouched) |

## What the session-restart state actually was (battery archaeology)

- **Battery 1** (`prefix-run-1355/`, binaries built 13:55): **14 failures.** The previous
  agent's mid-flight source fixes (per-stage `pos_d`, load barrier — found uncommitted in
  the local worktree, file-mtime 14:02) were on disk but **never compiled** before the
  session died. Battery 1 is therefore the *bug evidence* for those fixes: dev01 serial
  1-step graze (`FAIL [serial]: 1/48 ... first @ step 0 idx 79492`), split5 serial
  all-steps with `ref=0.0` (half-built head mirror poisoning step-0 KV), overlap serial
  graze, pipelined FAIL everywhere, and the two streams0 arms aborting with
  `Error: "ppn deferred needs per-stage streams"` before printing any serial verdict.
- **Battery 2** (`prefix-run-1442/`, 14:21 binaries = mid-flight fixes + the streams0 gate
  fix compiled in): **serial ALL PASS** (load barrier + per-stage pos_d confirmed),
  pipelined still FAIL on 8 arms.
- **Battery 3** (final build): all green, above.

## Root-caused fixes landed this session (each with its receipt)

1. **ppn-gate streams0 no-verdict** — the deferred API correctly refuses
   `MEMRA_PP_STREAMS=0`, but the gate binary propagated the error and the *serial* verdict
   was never printed (battery-1 streams0 logs). Fix: skip the pipelined arm with a printed
   NOTE. Battery 2/3: `ppn gate PASS [serial]` + `NOTE: pipelined arm skipped`.
2. **Boundary-slot first-use race** (the deterministic pipelined FAIL class): the slot
   buffer's lazy `alloc_zeros` memset enqueues on the **RX** stage stream, the TX copy on
   the **TX** stream, and on first use `ev_rx` was never recorded — nothing orders them.
   With ≥2 tokens in flight the RX stream is still busy, the memset lands **after** the TX
   copy, and the boundary residual is zeroed. Bisect receipt: window=1 PASS, window≥2 FAIL
   at the slot-1 first-use step; `-overlap` arms passed because the serial arm pre-warmed
   both slots. Fix: one-time `s_rx.synchronize()` per slot allocation (≤2·(N−1) syncs per
   process, all during prime). Post-fix: dev01 pipelined PASS deterministic.
3. **Per-stage Engine isolation on the primary device**: `Engine` owns lazily-grown
   stable-pointer scratch pools (`fa_part_pool`, `argmax_partials`, `fa_vf16_scratch`, …)
   — safe single-stream by design, a data race once two stage streams run concurrently
   through the *same* Engine (singledev placement + deferred readback: token t+1 stage-0
   fa memsets the partials while token t stage-s fa still reads them). Cross-device arms
   were immune because remote stages already had their own Engine — exactly the observed
   battery-2 split. Fix: every stage s>0 builds its own Engine even on the primary device
   (same retained CUcontext, so the per-context CUmodule cache keeps it cheap).
4. **Cache-birth barrier**: with the door open but no device placement, `Cache::new`
   memsets enqueue on the primary worker stream while first KV appends run on per-stage
   streams — unordered. `pp::new_cache` now syncs every stage context after creation
   (same class as the load barrier).

## Standing NEGATIVE (closed by quarantine): single-device pipelined

After all four fixes, a **x20 same-build soak** of the singledev N=2 pipelined arm
(`soak-singledev/`) landed **13/20 PASS, 7/20 FAIL (35% flake)** — every failure a
different first-divergence step (6, 11, 13, 14, 16, 25, 28): a timing-dependent
cross-stream race, not a logic bug. The controlled twin, a **x10 dev01 soak**
(`soak-dev01/`), was **10/10 PASS** on the same build/window/model, and an N=8
cross-device soak (`soak-n8/`) 5/5 — cross-device pipelined has **0 failures in 23/23
post-fix runs**.

Bisect trail (receipts in `soak-singledev-pdl0/`, `soak-singledev-pdlwb0/`,
`soak-singledev-fixed/`): `MEMRA_PDL=0` went 20/20 clean; the narrower `MEMRA_PDL_WB=0`
8/10; but a follow-up naked soak on a build that auto-disabled PDL for this regime still
failed 2/20 (n2, first-divergence steps 13 and 44) and battery-4 reproduced an n4
singledev pipelined FAIL — so **PDL's programmatic early-launch widens the race window
but is not the root cause**; the underlying unsound surface is the shared-Engine kernels
running concurrently on two streams of one device.

Resolution shipped: `decode_step_h_ppn_deferred` now **refuses** placements that put 2+
stage streams on one device (loud error; `MEMRA_PP_FORCE_SAME_DEV_PIPELINED=1` overrides
for soak/bisect measurement only), and ppn-gate skips that arm with a printed NOTE.
Wrong-logits-fast is not a mode memra ships. Single-device multi-stage remains fully
supported on the serial arm (bit-identical everywhere, incl. streams0).

**Battery 5** (quarantine build, 19:10Z): quarantine NOTEs printed on all three singledev
pipelined arms as designed, all serial arms PASS — and it caught **one cross-device
pipelined FAIL** (`ppn-q9-n2-dev01`: 37/48 from step 11; serial arm of the same
invocation PASS). That is the FIRST cross-device occurrence: the post-fix cross-device
pipelined record is **~1 failure in ~70 runs** (battery 3+4+5 arms, dev01 x5 probe,
soak-dev01 x10, soak-n8 x5, soak-dev01-x20 20/20, soak-dev01-pdl0 x20 20/20). So the
race is **same-device-dominant (35%) but not same-device-exclusive** — the shared
surface reachable cross-device is smaller but real (stage-0's primary Engine runs token
t+1 while the readback/last-stage machinery drains token t).

The x100 quarantine-lift bar was then run and MET: `soak-dev01-x100/` = **100/100 PASS**
(pipelined AND serial), plus a **long-sequence gate** (`gate-dev23-long/`, P=64 N=192 =
256 steps, devices 2,3) **5/5 PASS both arms** — the bit-identity contract holds at 5x
the standard gate depth. Final post-fix cross-device pipelined record: **1 failure in
~190 runs (~0.5%)**, the single battery-5 flake standing as recorded evidence that the
mechanism exists cross-device at low probability. Verdict: cross-device pipelined is
cleared for continued M3 development behind its default-OFF door; it is NOT cleared as
a serving default (that requires root-causing the ~0.5% event). Same-device stays
quarantined. PDL narrows the window on both placements (20/20@x20 with `MEMRA_PDL=0`)
but the naked singledev soak still failed 2/20 on the auto-gated build, so PDL-off is
mitigation, not fix — auto-gating was reverted.

## Throughput (final build only; interleaved ×5 at the invocation level)

`run-m2-bench.sh`, P=32 G=128, five outer rounds, arm rows appended per round — raw JSONL
in `bench-q9-*.log`. Baseline on GPU1 (`CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1`, unsharded load, door
shut); N=2/4 on devices 1.. (GPU0 kept free); N=8 takes all eight. Same-session
denominator; medians of N=5, full-power regime (box otherwise idle per
`gpu-state-pre-bench.txt`).

| config | serial-pp median tok/s | pipelined-pp median tok/s | vs baseline 185.8 |
|---|---|---|---|
| baseline (1 GPU, door shut) | 185.83 [184.49–188.24] | — | 1.00x |
| N=2 sharded (dev 1,2) | 185.39 [184.81–185.85] | **346.87** [345.71–350.60] | 1.00x / **1.87x** |
| N=4 sharded (dev 1–4) | 167.73 [167.18–167.91] | **350.04** [342.23–351.28] | 0.90x / **1.88x** |
| N=8 sharded (dev 0–7) | 165.12 [164.75–165.71] | **332.17** [325.74–333.17] | 0.89x / **1.79x** |
| N=2 noshard (peer-read) | 55.53 | 64.40 | 0.30x / 0.35x |
| N=4 noshard | 42.76 | 51.95 | 0.23x / 0.28x |
| N=8 noshard | 38.65 | 46.18 | 0.21x / 0.25x |

Reads:

- **Deferred readback is the M2 payoff: 1.87–1.88x single-stream decode at N=2/4.** The
  win saturates at N=2 — it comes from tokens-in-flight (window 3 in the bench loop), not
  stage count; N=8 pays more boundary hops for the same window (1.79x).
- **Serial cross-device N=2 is free** (185.4 vs 185.8 — inside the round-to-round band),
  confirming M0's 0.3–0.5% tick prediction at N=2. **N=4/8 serial costs ~10%** — 3–7
  boundary crossings per token with no overlap to hide them. NEGATIVE row, recorded.
- **Peer-read weight placement is a 3–4x cliff** (row 5–7). Sharding (increment 2) is not
  an optimization, it is the difference between a working and a broken multi-GPU config;
  `MEMRA_PP_SHARD=0` stays rollback-only.
- An earlier bench pass (archived `bench-prefix-broken-pipelined/`) ran on a pre-fix build
  whose pipelined arm computed **wrong logits** (e.g. N=2 292.8 tok/s) — those rows are
  excluded from every claim; wrong math is not a data point.

## fa-deep sm_90a validation (v0.67 H100-side evidence, rode this box)

The fa-deep rewrite (`55736e4f`, post-dates this lane's branch point) was staged as a
separate tree (`~/memra-fadeep`) and gated behind the same GPU lock — receipts in
`fadeep-h100/`:

```
fa_decode_v4_deep vs v4 (eager) t_kv=512:  bitdiff=0 OK
fa_decode_v4_deep vs v4 (dc)    t_kv=512  bucket=512/640:   bitdiff=0 OK
fa_decode_v4_deep vs v4 (eager) t_kv=3071: bitdiff=0 OK
fa_decode_v4_deep vs v4 (dc)    t_kv=3071 bucket=3071/3199: bitdiff=0 OK
ALL GREEN: kernels match CPU reference.        (kernel-check, 0 FAIL lines)
prefill argmax=268  decode argmax=268 ... MATCH (run-gen q9 naked)

## Next increments (explicitly not in this window's code)

1. Microbatch boundary slots (+ graph capture) — the M2 mission item with no lane
   implementation yet; requires batched residual slots and a batched deferred API.
2. Root-cause the singledev pipelined intermittent (mempool cross-stream reuse is the
   lead suspect); until closed, single-device multi-stage stays serial-arm-only guidance.
3. 5090-rig re-gate before any runtime default moves (Sbox/H100 evidence ≠ default flip).
