# pipeprime — chunk-pipelined PP-2 prime

Branch: `lane/cx-pipeline-prime`
Base: `2fc86b14` (Lever B walker + step35 batched decode merged)

## Mission

Overlap stage 0 of prime chunk N+1 with stage 1 of chunk N. The serial Lever-B split is
the arithmetic oracle and rollback path:

- serial split baseline: pp4096 **266.1 tok/s** (N=5, 22+23 layers);
- pipeline seam: `MEMRA_PRIME_PIPE=0`;
- exactness bar: every returned f32 bit and the primed-cache continuation must match the
  serial split;
- target class: balanced-stage overlap, approximately 400-500 tok/s if scheduling and
  transport costs remain hidden.

## Increment 0 — structural reading and ordering verdict

### Existing walker

`prime_chunk_ppn` already provides the stage-local pieces needed by a chunk pipeline:

- stage 0 owns embed, its `pos_d`, layers `[0, fence[1])`, and its KV/recurrent writes;
- stage 1 waits the boundary publication, owns its `pos_d`, remaining layers and KV
  writes, then runs output norm + head;
- boundary transport is `PpNRt::tx/rx`, with two persistent grow-only slots available
  under `MEMRA_PP_OVERLAP=1`;
- `fence_stages_behind` runs at walker entry and `publish_to` orders the last-stage
  device results before the caller consumes them;
- per-device prime slabs and stage-owned caches are already in place.

The current `prime_cache` chunk loop is still strictly serial: a complete
`prime_chunk_ppn` returns before the next chunk starts. It also relies on `cache.pos` as
the current chunk base and advances it in the per-chunk epilogue, so pipelining must make
each chunk's base explicit rather than letting stage 0 of N+1 observe stage 1 of N's
later host-side position update.

### Old deferred-pipeline flake

The 2026-08-02 deferred decode arm recorded a low-rate cross-device flake and a much
higher same-device flake. The later #87 failure supplied the allocator mechanism:
stage-allocated buffers were freed on a stage stream while the primary stream still had
queued reads, then reused and overwritten by later stage work. `PpNRt::fence_stages_behind`
now orders every stage stream behind the caller before new stage allocations, and the
Lever-B walker invokes it at entry. That closes the old allocator reverse-publication
mechanism for the serial walker and for caller-visible buffers crossing chunk calls.

Chunk pipelining still needs the separate boundary-slot anti-reuse edge. The existing
transport already expresses it:

1. stage 0 TX waits the selected slot's prior `ev_rx`;
2. stage 1 RX waits `ev_tx`, copies the slot into stage-owned work, then records `ev_rx`;
3. only after that copy may the same slot be overwritten by a later chunk.

Therefore the old flake mechanism is **dead under the new entry fences**, and no new
global caller/stage fence is required. The pipeline must preserve the existing
write-after-read event chain. If stage 1 is changed to consume the persistent slot
directly instead of the copied work buffer, `ev_rx` must move after the stage-1 layer
range; recording it at RX would reopen the exact anti-reverse-publication hole.

### Implementation shape

The minimum safe shape is a PP-2-specific chunk scheduler:

- double-buffer boundary slots by enabling slot alternation for this path;
- enqueue stage 0 chunk N, publish its boundary slot;
- enqueue stage 1 chunk N after that slot's `ev_tx`;
- before draining stage 1 N, enqueue stage 0 chunk N+1 into the other slot;
- on slot reuse, rely on TX's wait for that slot's prior `ev_rx`;
- keep stage-local chunk bases/positions explicit and preserve per-stage stream order for
  KV writes;
- drain each stage-1 result in original chunk order, copying its hidden stack and retaining
  only the final chunk's logits/h_seed exactly as the serial loop does.

## Gate plan

| Gate | Required verdict |
|---|---|
| `ppsplit` serial split vs pipelined | bit-identical plus pipeline-overlap counter advances |
| `chunkinv35` / `tickinv35` + canaries | pass / teeth |
| `kernel-check` | ALL GREEN |
| `run-gen` over PP-2 | argmax MATCH |
| `run-spec` K=1..8 | pinned acceptance, all pass |
| pp4096 soak | at least 200 pipelined primes, zero divergence/fault |
| perf | pp512/2048/4096 serial-vs-pipeline N=5 interleaved, one flock hold |
| serve | 4k TTFT receipt |

Raw logs will live under `research/pipeprime-20260808/raw/`; every claimed median will
state N and thermal regime.

## Increment 1 — position contract and rollback seam

Behavior-neutral groundwork:

- `MEMRA_PRIME_PIPE=0` is the live-per-call rollback seam;
- `PRIME_PIPE_OVERLAPS` is the gate-visible schedule-liveness counter;
- `prime_layers` now receives the chunk's absolute `base` explicitly instead of reading
  mutable `cache.pos`.

The serial walker still supplies `base = cache.pos`, so this increment does not change
launch order or arithmetic. The explicit base is required before stage 0 of N+1 can be
issued while stage 1 of N still owns the current host position.

## Increment 2 — double-buffer transport primitives

`PpNRt` now exposes:

- `prepare_overlap_slots`: grow both boundary slots and perform the required RX-stream
  first-use synchronization before either stage is queued;
- `tx_pipelined`: force boundary-local atomic A/B alternation independently of the
  decode-side `MEMRA_PP_OVERLAP` flag.

Prewarming is load-bearing for a two-chunk prompt. Without it, slot B's first lazy
allocation synchronizes the RX stream after stage 1 of chunk N is queued, draining that
work before stage 0 of N+1 can publish and making the apparent pipeline serial.

## Increment 3 — PP-2 chunk scheduler

The scheduler is now wired for chunked PP-2 primes:

1. fence both stage streams behind prior caller reads;
2. prewarm boundary slots A/B;
3. enqueue stage 0(N), then stage 1(N);
4. enqueue stage 0(N+1) through the alternate slot before stage 1(N)'s epilogue D2H;
5. drain N in order, publish/copy its hidden stack, then apply the #87 reverse fence
   before stage 1(N+1) can allocate;
6. repeat, retaining the same per-chunk epilogue arithmetic as the serial split.

`PRIME_PIPE_OVERLAPS` advances once per N→N+1 issue pair. Same-device multi-stream
placement refuses with an instruction to use one device per stage or
`MEMRA_PRIME_PIPE=0`; the known quarantined surface is not silently re-enabled.

## Increment 4 — standing exactness and liveness gate

`ppsplit` now runs three schedules over one sharded load:

- unsplit reference (`MEMRA_PRIME_PP=0`);
- serial split (`MEMRA_PRIME_PIPE=0`);
- pipelined split (default).

It compares logits, h_seed, the full hidden stack, and teacher-forced continuation logits
bit-for-bit. Both split arms must advance `PRIME_SPLIT_CHUNKS`; only the pipelined arm
may advance `PRIME_PIPE_OVERLAPS`, by at least `chunk_count - 1`.

The `ppsplitc` canary now forces only the pipeline arm back to the serial split. Split
liveness remains valid, so the canary can pass only when the overlap assertion itself
detects the missing schedule.

## Increment 5 — first box2 exactness receipt

Box2 (`<box2-ip>`, 2x RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell), release build at `97dec983`,
CUDA 13.2. One GPU-lock hold, Step-3.7 IQ4_XS, T=4883:

| chunk | serial vs unsplit | pipeline vs serial | split liveness | overlap liveness |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 4096 | all compared bits equal | all compared bits equal | ref/serial/pipe = 0/2/2 | ref/serial/pipe = 0/0/1, need 1 |
| 513 | all compared bits equal | all compared bits equal | ref/serial/pipe = 0/10/10 | ref/serial/pipe = 0/0/9, need 9 |

Compared surfaces are last-row logits, h_seed, full `[T,n_embd]` hidden stack, and eight
teacher-forced continuation-logit vectors over the primed KV. Verdict:
**UNSPLIT/SERIAL/PIPE BIT-IDENTICAL + LIVE**.

Receipts:

- `raw/ppsplit-naked-raw-20260808T070244Z.log`
- `raw/ppsplit-naked-summary-20260808T070244Z.log`

Pipeline-specific canary (`MEMRA_PRIME_PIPE=0` only in the PIPE arm):

- serial split liveness stayed live at 2/10 chunks;
- every compared bit still matched;
- pipeline overlap counts were 0/0 against required 1/9;
- probe verdict was `PIPE-NOT-LIVE`, wrapper verdict **PASS (canary has teeth)**.

- `raw/ppsplit-canary-summary-20260808T070722Z.log`

## Increment 6 — chunk/tick composition receipts

Box2, release build at `97dec983`, one GPU-lock hold:

| Gate | Pipeline verdict | Canary verdict |
|---|---|---|
| `chunkinv35` | PASS: chunks 4096/513/512/256/64 bit-identical through 24 continuation steps | PASS: legacy SWA seam diverged at rows 513/512 |
| `tickinv35` | PASS: budgets 0/1024/513/512/256/64 and split calls 64/256/512 bit-identical through 24 continuation steps | PASS: legacy call-local seam diverged in every nonzero/split arm |

The default pipeline therefore composes with both internal chunking and caller-side prefill
ticks. The canaries prove that the comparison surfaces still detect the two historical
chunk/tick dependence classes.

## Increment 7 — target-rig acceptance battery

Box2, one GPU-lock hold, PP-2 placement `0,1`:

| Gate | Verdict |
|---|---|
| model-backed `kernel-check` | **ALL GREEN** |
| `run-gen` PP-2 | **MATCH**: prefill/decode argmax 6776; batched-prime/tokenwise argmax 6776 |
| `run-spec` K=1..8 | **8/8 self-consistency PASS** |

Spec acceptance remained at the pinned values: K=1 `14/17 = 82.4%`; K=2..8 each
accepted exactly 15 tokens (`15/32` through `15/128`). Thermal observations were
31-37 C; the final clocks were 2370/2272 MHz and both cards returned to 0 MiB.

## Diagnostic 1 — enqueue-order liveness was vacuous

The first equal-microchunk perf sweep disproved the initial liveness counter. N=5,
alternating SERIAL/PIPE order, one GPU-lock hold:

| shape | serial | initial PIPE | ratio |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| pp512, T=461, chunk=256 | 245.4 tok/s | 246.6 tok/s | 1.005x |
| pp2048, T=1833, chunk=1024 | 263.7 tok/s | 263.5 tok/s | 0.999x |
| pp4096, T=4096, chunk=2048 | 265.4 tok/s | 265.8 tok/s | 1.002x |

`PRIME_PIPE_OVERLAPS` advanced once in every PIPE sample, but the devices did not perform
the two stage walks concurrently. Step's resident-MoE prefill still performs a router
readback plus stream synchronization in every MoE layer. A single host thread therefore
finished the stage-1 walker before it could enter stage 0 of the next chunk, even though
the high-level call happened before the epilogue drain.

This receipt invalidates "enqueued before epilogue" as the overlap-liveness definition.
The scheduler must use concurrent stage-owned host walkers, and the counter must advance
only while both walkers are active.

- `raw/pp4096-raw-20260808T073806Z.log`

## Increment 8 — concurrent stage-owned host walkers

The corrected scheduler:

- moves stage-0 and stage-1 KV/recurrent layer state into two owned cache shells for the
  duration of the prime, then restores the parent cache;
- uses per-device prime-slab mutexes rather than one model-wide lock;
- binds each scoped host thread to its stage CUDA context;
- runs stage 1(N) and stage 0(N+1) on those two host threads;
- advances `PRIME_PIPE_OVERLAPS` only on an active-walker transition from one stage to
  two, not from high-level call order.

The three-arm gate remained bit-identical over logits, h_seed, full hidden stacks, and
eight continuation-logit vectors. Active-walker overlap counts were exactly 1 at chunk
4096 and 9 at chunk 513.

Two-microchunk N=5 diagnostic, alternating order, one GPU-lock hold:

| shape | serial | concurrent PIPE | ratio |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| pp512, T=461, chunk=256 | 245.7 tok/s | 307.2 tok/s | 1.250x |
| pp2048, T=1833, chunk=1024 | 263.0 tok/s | 326.4 tok/s | 1.241x |
| pp4096, T=4096, chunk=2048 | 265.5 tok/s | 339.5 tok/s | 1.279x |

This is the expected two-microbatch fill/drain regime: ideal two-stage speedup is capped
at 4/3 before fixed overhead. It proves real concurrency and clears the small-prompt stop
bar, but it is not the final geometry; the next sweep increases microbatch count.

## Increment 9 — microchunk geometry sweep

Exploratory N=3 medians, alternating order, one GPU-lock hold:

| shape | chunk | chunks | serial | PIPE | speedup |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| pp512 | 128 | 4 | 221.8 | **326.0** | 1.470x |
| pp512 | 64 | 7 | 197.8 | 323.0 | 1.633x |
| pp2048 | 512 | 4 | 257.7 | 376.2 | 1.460x |
| pp2048 | 256 | 8 | **248.2** | **399.4** | 1.609x |
| pp4096 | 1024 | 4 | 264.9 | 392.2 | 1.481x |
| pp4096 | 512 | 8 | 258.8 | **417.5** | 1.613x |
| pp4096 | 256 | 16 | 251.1 | 423.7 | 1.688x |

Every PIPE sample reported exactly `chunks - 1` concurrent active-walker overlaps.
The practical default candidate targets up to eight microchunks with a 128-token floor:
pp512 selects 128, pp2048 lands near 256, and pp4096 selects 512. The 16-chunk pp4096
arm buys only 1.5% more absolute throughput while doubling host-thread, boundary, and
per-chunk epilogue count. Final N=5 measurements remain pending.

## Increment 10 - naked auto geometry and final composition battery

The measured policy is now the naked PP-2 default when `MEMRA_PRIME_CHUNK` is unset:
target at most eight microchunks, with a 128-token floor and a 4096-token ceiling.
An explicit `MEMRA_PRIME_CHUNK` remains authoritative. `MEMRA_PRIME_PIPE=0` keeps the
same chunk boundaries and disables only stage overlap, so the rollback remains a
schedule-only comparison.

Box2 rebuilt every `memra-engine` release binary at final code candidate `61c8d2f2`.
One GPU-lock hold then ran the final schedule/composition battery:

| Gate | Naked pipeline verdict | Canary verdict |
|---|---|---|
| `ppsplit`, T=4883, auto chunk 611 | all L/H/S/D bits equal; split 0/8/8; overlap 0/0/7 | forced serial PIPE retained 8 split chunks and produced 0/7 overlaps |
| `ppsplit`, T=4883, chunk 513 | all L/H/S/D bits equal; split 0/10/10; overlap 0/0/9 | forced serial PIPE retained 10 split chunks and produced 0/9 overlaps |
| `chunkinv35` | chunks 4096/513/512/256/64 exact through 24 steps | legacy SWA seam diverged at rows 513/512 |
| `tickinv35` | budgets 0/1024/513/512/256/64 and split calls 64/256/512 exact through 24 steps | legacy call-local seam diverged in every nonzero/split arm |

The final tick gate exercises the new auto policy directly: a 1024-token caller tick is
internally split into eight 128-token pipeline microchunks. The run ended at 43/44 C,
2370/2272 MHz, and both GPUs returned to 0 MiB. Verdict: **FINAL COMPOSITION BATTERY
GREEN**.

## Increment 11 - final-code target acceptance battery

Box2 reran the full acceptance battery against release binaries built from final code
candidate `61c8d2f2`, under one GPU-lock hold:

| Gate | Verdict |
|---|---|
| model-backed `kernel-check` | **ALL GREEN** |
| PP-2 `run-gen` | **MATCH**: prefill/decode argmax 6776; batched-prime/tokenwise argmax 6776 |
| PP-2 `run-spec` K=1..8 | **8/8 self-consistency PASS** |

The pinned speculative-acceptance ledger was unchanged: K=1 accepted `14/17 = 82.4%`;
K=2..8 each accepted 15 tokens (`15/32` through `15/128`). The run ended at 37/36 C,
2370/2272 MHz, with both devices back at 0 MiB.

## Increment 12 - pp4096 pipeline soak

Box2 ran 200 fresh naked-auto pp4096 pipeline primes under one GPU-lock hold. Auto
geometry resolved to chunk 512: eight chunks and seven required concurrent stage
transitions per prime.

| Soak surface | Result |
|---|---:|
| pipelined primes | 200/200 |
| exactness failures | 0 |
| overlap-liveness failures | 0 |
| minimum verified active-walker transitions | 1,400 |
| CUDA / illegal-address / MMU / mismatch fault-scan hits | 0 |

Each fresh pipeline cache was compared bit-for-bit with the serial split over logits,
h_seed, the full hidden stack, and one teacher-forced continuation step. The summary
verdict was **EXACT+SPLIT-LIVE+PIPE-LIVE**. The run started at 31/30 C and ended at
44/46 C, 2422/2422 MHz, with both GPUs back at 0 MiB.

This zero-fault soak is consistent with the ordering verdict: the old allocator
reverse-publication mechanism is closed by `fence_stages_behind`, while boundary-slot
reuse retains its separate TX-waits-RX event edge. It does not make a statistical claim
stronger than the 200-prime sample.

## Increment 13 - final interleaved prefill performance

Final naked-auto medians on box2, N=5 with one warmup, alternating SERIAL/PIPE order
inside each process and one GPU-lock hold across all three shapes:

| shape | auto geometry | serial, same geometry | PIPE | schedule speedup | prior Lever-B naked baseline | gain vs Lever B |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| pp512-class, T=461 | chunk 128, 4 chunks | 223.4 tok/s | **330.0 tok/s** | 1.477x | 248.3 tok/s | 1.329x |
| pp2048-class, T=1833 | chunk 230, 8 chunks | 247.7 tok/s | **401.8 tok/s** | 1.622x | 263.2 tok/s | 1.527x |
| pp4096, T=4096 | chunk 512, 8 chunks | 258.6 tok/s | **417.6 tok/s** | 1.615x | 266.1 tok/s | **1.569x** |

Every PIPE warmup and timed repetition reported exactly `chunks - 1` concurrent
active-walker overlaps; every SERIAL sample reported zero. The pp4096 result is in the
requested 400-500 tok/s class. The same-geometry serial arm is the schedule-only oracle;
its additional microchunk epilogues explain why it is slightly below Lever B's prior
single-chunk 266.1 tok/s baseline.

The hold started cold at 30/30 C and ended at 43/44 C, 2370/2422 MHz, with both cards
back at 0 MiB. All reported values are medians of five timed repetitions, not single
runs.

## Increment 14 - final 4k serve TTFT

The first attempted TTFT run exposed a measurement-surface error: the earlier release
command rebuilt `memra-engine --bins`, but `memra-server` is a separate package. The
stale server binary predated Lever B and reproduced the old unsplit ~38 s floor. That
run is excluded from evidence. Box2 then rebuilt `memra-server` from final code candidate
`61c8d2f2` and reran the protocol in a clean receipt directory.

Streaming `/v1/chat/completions`, exact 4096-token prompt, one warmup plus N=5 per arm,
spec OFF, batch OFF, `MEMRA_PREFILL_TICK=1024`, one GPU-lock hold:

| arm | p50 TTFT | p95 | min-max |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| PIPE, naked auto | **11.009 s** | 11.012 s | 10.997-11.020 s |
| SERIAL, `MEMRA_PRIME_PIPE=0` | 17.946 s | 17.979 s | 17.918-17.985 s |
| prior Lever-B naked baseline | 15.47 s | 15.52 s | 15.46-15.55 s |

The pipeline is **1.630x** faster than the same-geometry serial schedule and reduces
TTFT by **28.8%** relative to Lever B's prior naked serve baseline. The valid arm logs
contain no CUDA fault, panic, fatal Xid, or request error. The hold started at 31/31 C
and ended at 39/39 C with both GPUs back at 0 MiB.

### Flake-mechanism verdict

The old deferred-pipeline allocator race is **dead under the current reverse-publication
fences**: stage streams cannot free/reuse caller-visible allocations before queued caller
reads complete. Boundary-slot reuse remains a distinct ordering surface and is covered by
the existing `TX wait(ev_rx) -> RX copy -> record(ev_rx)` chain. Because stage 1 consumes
a copied work buffer, no additional boundary edge is required. The 200-prime soak found
zero divergence, liveness failure, or fault; this supports the mechanism verdict without
claiming more statistical power than the sample provides.

| Gate | Final verdict |
|---|---|
| release build, final engine/server binaries | PASS |
| `ppsplit` auto/513 | bit-identical unsplit/serial/PIPE; true overlaps 7/9 |

| `chunkinv35` / canary | PASS / teeth |
| `tickinv35` / canary | PASS / teeth |
| model-backed `kernel-check` | ALL GREEN |
| PP-2 `run-gen` | argmax MATCH, 6776 |
| PP-2 `run-spec` K=1..8 | 8/8 PASS at pinned acceptance |
| pp4096 soak | 200/200 exact+live; 0 faults; at least 1,400 true overlaps |
| prefill perf | 330.0 / 401.8 / 417.6 tok/s at pp512/2048/4096 |
