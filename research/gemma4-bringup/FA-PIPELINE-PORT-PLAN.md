# FA pipeline port plan — the last ~3.5% of 12B prefill (2026-07-22)

State: 12B pp1736 0.965x llama interleaved (laptop 175W), decode 0.984x. GEMM at parity
(kernel diff 2026-07-22); the残 excess is FA-structural. llama's `fattn-mma-f16.cuh` config
table (commit c818263f2) is the blueprint — measured configs, not guesses:

| shape | ncols (q-rows/CTA) | threads | occupancy | nbatch_fa (BK) | nstages | Q_in_reg |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| hd256, ncols 32-64 (Blackwell rows 69-72) | 32-64 | 128 | 2 | 32 | **2** | **true** |
| hd512 (rows 77-80) | 8-64 | 64-256 | 4→1 | 32 | 1 | false |

Our current kernels vs that:

- `fa_prefill_w_bf16_pp`/`_g4` (hd256 SWA): 64 rows, 4 warps, occ 2 — geometry matches, but
  **synchronous stage** (ld.global→cvt→st.shared between __syncthreads) and **sQ staged through
  smem** each Q load. llama overlaps the next K/V chunk load (cp.async, nstages=2) with the
  current chunk's mma, and holds Q in registers (no sQ traffic, no Q re-ldmatrix per step).
  Their chunking: nbatch_K2=128 — K/V staged in 128-element sub-tiles, so the double buffer
  costs 2 sub-tiles, not 2 full tiles (smem stays under the occ-2 budget). THE PORT:
  1. Q in registers (we already hold Qf fragments — drop the per-step sQ re-ldmatrix... done
     for pp body; the g4 variant re-uses load_q_frags_bf16 once — OK).
  2. cp.async 16B double-buffered K/V sub-tiles (128 elems = 16 int4 per row-chunk), ring of 2:
     preload chunk 0; loop { cp.async chunk i+1 → buf alt; cp.async.wait_group; compute chunk i }.
     bf16 source (pre-converted) keeps chunk bytes half of f32.
  3. Budget: sK/sV ring = 2 chunks × (32 rows × 128 elem × 2B) = 16KB + sP/sL ≈ 21KB/CTA →
     occ 2 holds. (Full-tile double-buffer = 64KB → occ 1 → loses; the CHUNKING is the trick.)
  Sized from kernel diff: fa_w ~40ms/prime vs llama hd256 class ~17ms → +2-3% pp1736.

- `fa_prefill_bf16_hd512_sp` (globals): 16 rows/CTA vs llama's 64 → they amortize each staged
  K/V tile over 4x more q-rows. Port: widen to 32 rows (2 warps × 16 rows each for GEMM0
  split-K stays; O per warp doubles to 64 CTiles = spill risk — so instead 4 warps × 16 rows,
  each warp owns a 128-dim V/O quarter, GEMM0 split-K 4 ways). smem: sQ 32KB + K/V chunked
  (nbatch style, not full 512) ≈ fits. Sized: fa512 ~26ms → ~15ms → +1-1.5% pp.

Order: hd256 first (bigger share: 40 SWA layers vs 8 globals). Both bit-identity-gated vs the
current kernels where op order is preserved (chunked cp.async staging does NOT change FP order —
the mma consumption order is unchanged; only the copy mechanism differs → bit-identical claim
holds for the hd256 port; the hd512 4-way split-K DOES reorder → own numeric config + battery).

Iteration rig: vast box (final numbers on the laptop only). Correctness: kernel-check windowed
gates + argmax/VERIFY battery per landing.

## §2 refined (2026-07-22 late): hd512 wide-tile geometry (from llama's 512-row config)

`fa_prefill_bf16_hd512_w64`: 64 q-rows/CTA, 8 warps (256 thr), grid (T/64, n_head).
- Q in SMEM (llama Q_in_reg=false at hd512): 64x512 bf16 = 64KB, staged once per CTA.
- K dim-CHUNKED (llama nbatch_K2=128): stage K[32 keys][128 dims] = 8KB per chunk; GEMM0
  accumulates over 4 chunks (kt order preserved within warp -> same FP order per row-dot).
- V dim-chunked likewise for GEMM1 (d0 walks chunk-local dims; O order preserved).
- Warps split ROWS (8 warps x 8 rows). Per-warp: Q re-ldmatrix from smem per kt; S = 8x32;
  softmax on own rows; O = 8 rows x 512 dims = 32 CTiles (128 regs, sp-proven).
- smem: sQ 64KB + K/V chunk ring 2x8KB + sP 8x32x2B x8 warps (4KB) + sL ~85KB -> occ 1 but
  K/V global traffic /4 vs sp (staged once per 64 rows).
- NUMERIC: per-row dot order = kt sequential as sp? NO — sp splits kt across warps (2-way
  partial sums); w64 keeps each row's FULL kt chain in ONE warp -> matches the ORIGINAL z2
  bf16 kernel's per-row order, NOT sp's. => own numeric config vs sp; gate oracle + battery.

## §2 VERDICT (2026-07-22): wide-tile CLOSED at the f32-exact class

Worked the geometry to exhaustion: (a) 64-row/8-warp with row-split warps needs 8-row warps —
breaks the 16-row CTile fragment mapping; (b) warp-pair dim-split brings back the z2 2x-GEMM0
duplication sp just removed; (c) sp-wide (32 rows, 2 row-blocks x 2 halves) needs
3x32KB(Q/K/V) + 4KB f32 partial-S + P/L = ~104KB > the 99KB sm_120 CTA cap; (d) 16-row warps
with full-512 register O = 64 f32 CTiles = 256 regs -> spills (the original z2 motivation).
llama's hd512 fits the same silicon because fa=1 accumulates S/P/O in F16 — half the register
and smem footprint for the same tile. OUR remaining hd512/hd256 FA gap vs llama is therefore a
NUMERIC-CLASS premium (we hold f32 online-softmax accumulation; they don't), not scheduling.

NEXT LEVER (legitimate, not tonight's): `BW24_FA_F16ACC` opt-in arm — f16-accum FA prefill
variants, the same speed/accuracy-tradeoff door class as BW24_MMQ W4A4 (precedented). It is
also the FAIRER A/B: llama's fa=1 default IS f16-accum, so exact-class bw24 vs f16 llama
undercounts us. Gate: full battery in-config (argmax/VERIFY/spec) + explicit flag doc.

## 31B glue lane (2026-07-23, from g31-glue-verdict): producers emit bf16

31B loses ~70ms/prime of GLUE to llama while winning GEMM and FA. Biggest safe cuts:
- `rope_neox2_bf16emit`: rope writes q/k f32 as today AND `qb/kb` bf16 (same __float2bfloat16
  the converter applied — FA operands bit-identical). Kills 2 of 3 converts + their re-reads.
- `rms_norm_qkv_w4` gains an optional `vb` bf16 emit (v is normed-but-never-roped).
- fa_prefill_* accept optional pre-converted operands (fall back to f32_to_bf16 when absent —
  non-gemma callers unchanged).
Both bit-identical on every stream -> bit-gates. Sized ~15-18ms/prime on 31B (+2%), ~+1% 12B.
NOT the block-per-row fused rms_norm_qkv_rope (would undo the warp-norm fix at depth).
