## Phase 0 — provision + first receipt: DONE

### Provisioning notes (for the next box of this family)

- DL-image `Deep Learning Base OSS Nvidia Driver GPU AMI Ubuntu 24.04 20260724` **does** ship
  CUDA toolkits — 12.8, 12.9, 13.0, **13.2** (`/usr/local/cuda -> cuda-13.2`). The
  "no toolkit" expectation from prior boxes of this family is stale for this AMI date.
- **`crates/memra-engine/build.rs:61` hardcodes `/usr/local/cuda-13.1/bin/nvcc`** as the
  default. On this box that path does not exist and the build dies with
  `panicked at build.rs:126: spawn nvcc: Os { code: 2, kind: NotFound }` — *not* an obvious
  "toolkit missing" message. Workaround used: `MEMRA_NVCC=/usr/local/cuda-13.2/bin/nvcc`.
  (Fix candidate for a later lane: resolve `nvcc` from `PATH`/`CUDA_HOME` before falling back
  to a pinned version. Out of scope here — no code change without a gate.)
- `cargo build --release --bins`: **3m58s**, arch auto-detected `120a` (compute_cap 12.0).
  0 errors. Toolchain: rustup stable (minimal), `build-essential pkg-config libssl-dev cmake`.

### THE P2P TRANSPORT RECEIPT (`logs/p2p-probe.log`, `logs/topo.txt`, `logs/pcie.csv`)

Topology: **`GPU0 <-> GPU1 = PIX`** — at most a single PCIe bridge, same NUMA node (0),
CPU affinity 0-47 both. The best possible non-NVLink arrangement. `lspci -tv` shows both
cards under one bridge chain (`0000:01 -> 00.0 -> [02-23]`).

**P2P is ON, natively, on the stock driver — both directions:**

```
canAccessPeer 0->1 = 1
canAccessPeer 1->0 = 1
peer_enabled=1
```

This closes the open question in `research/model-192gb-20260806/ASSESSMENT.md` §0 for THIS
silicon (previously inferred from the 5090-validation NOTE's PRO 6000 datapoint on driver
580.95 — now confirmed first-hand on 595.71.05, Server Edition, and measured).

`p2pBandwidthLatencyTest`-class numbers, `cudaMemcpyPeerAsync` vs a host-staged pinned
bounce (D2H then H2D — what a non-P2P PP boundary pays). Bandwidth iters 2000 (<1MB) /
300 (<16MB) / 40 (bulk); latency = mean of 5000 enqueue+sync rounds:

| payload | P2P uni GB/s | P2P bidir GB/s | host-bounce GB/s | P2P advantage |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 4 KB | 3.24 | 3.10 | 0.276 | **11.7x** |
| **12 KB** (122B boundary) | **10.21** | 9.39 | **0.751** | **13.6x** |
| **16 KB** (q27 n_embd 4096 f32) | **13.35** | 12.66 | **0.954** | **14.0x** |
| 64 KB | 45.76 | 49.55 | 3.86 | 11.9x |
| 256 KB | 53.83 | 105.45 | 11.02 | 4.9x |
| 1 MB | 56.02 | 107.69 | 20.06 | 2.8x |
| 4 MB | 56.58 | 108.12 | 25.60 | 2.2x |
| 16 MB | 56.23 | 107.13 | 27.50 | 2.0x |
| 64 MB | 55.48 | 106.08 | 28.00 | 2.0x |
| 256 MB | 54.53 | 104.60 | 28.15 | 1.9x |

One-way latency (single copy, enqueue+sync):

| payload | P2P us | host-bounce us | P2P advantage |
|---|---|---|---|
| 4 KB | 6.56 | 14.53 | 2.2x |
| 12 KB | 6.83 | 16.43 | 2.4x |
| 16 KB | 7.02 | 17.22 | 2.5x |
| 64 KB | 7.65 | 16.83 | 2.2x |

**Reading of the transport verdict:**

1. **P2P saturates at ~56 GB/s uni / ~107 GB/s bidir.** Full duplex works (bidir ≈ 1.9x uni),
   so the link is not shared-half-duplex. ~56 GB/s is PCIe **Gen5 x16**-class (~63 GB/s
   theoretical); the pair reaches ~89% of theoretical. Note `pcie.link.gen.current = 1` in
   `logs/pcie.csv` and `LnkSta: Speed 2.5GT/s (downgraded)` in `logs/acs.txt` — that is
   **idle-state power management** (both cards were at P8/30W when sampled), not a real
   downgrade: `LnkCap` reports `Speed 32GT/s, Width x16` and the measured 56 GB/s could not
   happen on a genuine Gen1 link. Recording this so nobody re-derives a false "the box is
   PCIe-gen-capped" conclusion from an idle `nvidia-smi` sample.
2. **At PP-boundary payload the win is not 2x, it is 13-14x.** The engine's boundary is
   `[n_embd] f32` per token — 16 KB for q27 (n_embd 4096), 12 KB for the 122B. At exactly
   those sizes bounce delivers 0.75-0.95 GB/s vs P2P's 10-13 GB/s. Small copies are
   latency-dominated and the bounce pays *two* sequential transfers plus two syncs.
3. **Per-token boundary cost, absolute:** a 16 KB P2P boundary copy is ~7.0 us one-way; the
   bounce is ~17.2 us. At a 12 ms/token decode tick (q27-class c=1) that is 0.06% vs 0.14%
   — both noise. The bounce penalty only becomes structural under **microbatch/batched
   decode**, where payload scales with batch (c=32 x 16 KB = 512 KB → 105 GB/s P2P vs
   11 GB/s bounce, a 9.6x gap on a per-tick-serial copy) — i.e. the transport arm matters
   for exactly the door that is unwired (batched decode over PP).
4. **Consequence for the bill:** `pp.rs` already ships `cudaMemcpyPeerAsync` as the
   cross-device boundary and grants peer + `cuMemPoolSetAccess` both ways at build. On this
   pair that path is **live and correct by construction** — there is no host-staged fallback
   to enable/wire, and no work item here. The ASSESSMENT's "transport is NOT the problem on
   this pair" is now measured, not projected. **Phase-2 item 1 is therefore CLOSED as
   already-shipped**, and the bill's weight moves entirely to the serving loops.

### Probe source

`logs/p2p_probe.cu` — kept beside the log so the numbers are reproducible. Built
`nvcc -O3 -arch=sm_120`. (Patched once at bring-up: `cudaDeviceProp::memoryClockRate` was
removed in CUDA 13.x — dropped the derived theoretical-BW print.)

## Phase 1 — PP-2 gate battery on target silicon: **GREEN, 0 failures**

Vehicle: Qwen3.5-9B-NVFP4-MTP (5.7 GB, n_layers 32, n_vocab 248320) — the same model class
the M1 `pp2-gate` and M2 `ppn-gate` receipts were minted on, so this is a same-vehicle
cross-rig comparison. Staged to `/scratch-models` on the box's local root NVMe.
Driver: `run-pp2-gates.sh` (committed here), receipts `logs/gates/`.

**This is the FIRST time the PP gates have ever run on an RTX PRO 6000 pair.** Prior
receipts: M1/M2 on 8xH100 NVSwitch, single-GPU degenerate on the 5090. The 192 GB
assessment named this as mandatory-before-listing. It is now done.

| Gate | Config | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| `kernel-check` (full battery) | naked | **ALL GREEN — kernels match CPU reference**, 0 FAIL lines |
| `pp-transport-smoke` | 2 devices | **PASS** — canAccessPeer 1/1, peer-arm bytediff=0, 4 boundary roundtrips bytediff=0 |
| `ppn-gate` N=2 singledev | serial | **PASS BIT-IDENTICAL** 48 steps (pipelined correctly skipped — quarantine NOTE fires) |
| `ppn-gate` N=2 **dev01** | serial + pipelined | **PASS BIT-IDENTICAL** both arms |
| `ppn-gate` N=2 **dev10** (reversed placement) | serial + pipelined | **PASS BIT-IDENTICAL** both arms |
| `ppn-gate` N=2 dev01 `SHARD=0` | serial + pipelined | **PASS BIT-IDENTICAL** both arms (bring-up peer-read placement) |
| `ppn-gate` N=2 dev01 `OVERLAP=1` | serial + pipelined | **PASS BIT-IDENTICAL** both arms |
| `ppn-gate` N=2 dev01 `SPLITS=5` (off-center) | serial + pipelined | **PASS BIT-IDENTICAL** both arms |
| `ppn-gate` N=2 `STREAMS=0` (inc-1 seam) | serial | **PASS BIT-IDENTICAL** (pipelined skipped by design) |
| `ppn-gate` N=4 `dev=0,1,0,1` | serial | **PASS BIT-IDENTICAL** fence [0,8,16,24,32] |
| `ppn-gate` N=4 `dev=0,0,1,1` | serial | **PASS BIT-IDENTICAL** |
| `pp2-gate` legacy singledev | M1 semantics | **PASS BIT-IDENTICAL** |
| `pp2-gate` legacy dev01 | M1 semantics | **PASS BIT-IDENTICAL** |
| `run-gen` naked argmax (door shut) | q9 | **MATCH** (`prefill argmax=268 decode argmax=268`) |

`script-detected failures: 0`.

Notes worth keeping:
- **Exactness vs single-GPU is proven the strong way, not the weak way.** `ppn-gate`'s
  method is not "PP-2 output looks like 1-GPU output" — it records full `n_vocab` f32 logits
  per step with the door OFF, then replays the identical token stream with the door ON and
  compares every f32 *bit*. 48 steps x 248,320 logits, zero differing bits, on every arm.
- **Both placement orders pass.** `dev01` and `dev10` are not symmetric in the engine (stage
  0 owns the embed table + `pos_d`, the last stage owns `output_norm` + lm head, and the
  primary engine's device is a third variable). `dev10` had never been gated; it passes.
- **N=4 over 2 cards works on the serial arm** — the 2-stages-per-card shape a deeper split
  on a pair would take. Its pipelined arm is correctly refused by the same-device quarantine
  (2+ stage streams on one device), which is the right behavior, not a gap in this shape.
- The quarantine plumbing behaves exactly as designed on new silicon: the NOTE fires on
  `singledev`, `dev0101`, and `dev0011`; no arm silently ran an unsound placement.

### Flake-arm repro on P2P silicon — **the flake does NOT reproduce on this pair**

Both quarantines in `research/m2-pp8-20260802/RESULTS.md` were minted on **8xH100 SXM /
NVSwitch** (the 5090 rig has one GPU, so `devices=0,0` there is the degenerate case). Two
questions, both answered on-target. Drivers `run-pp2-soak.sh` + `run-pp2-forced.sh`,
receipts `logs/soak/`, one log per run.

| Soak arm | Placement | H100 record | **PRO 6000 pair result** |
|---|---|---|---|
| cross-device pipelined | `dev01`, x40 + x40 (two batches) | ~1 FAIL in ~190 (~0.5%), root cause open | **80/80 PASS, 0 FAIL** |
| cross-device serial | `dev01`, x40 | clean | **40/40 PASS, 0 FAIL** |
| same-device serial | singledev, x20 | clean | **20/20 PASS**, quarantine NOTE 20/20 |
| **same-device pipelined, FORCED** | `MEMRA_PP_FORCE_SAME_DEV_PIPELINED=1`, x20 | **13/20 PASS, 7/20 FAIL (35% flake)** | **20/20 PASS, 0 FAIL** |

**The forced-arm row is the headline.** The 35%-flake placement — 2+ stage streams on one
device, refused by default since 2026-08-02 — ran **20/20 bit-identical** here, serial and
pipelined both. Under the H100-measured p=0.35 failure rate, 20 consecutive clean runs has
probability `0.65^20 = 2.1e-4`. So the H100 failure *rate* is **statistically refuted on
this silicon** (p < 0.001); this is not "we got lucky."

What that does and does not license:

- **It does NOT unquarantine anything.** The root cause named in the M2 write-up is real and
  code-visible: `Engine` owns lazily-grown stable-pointer scratch pools (`fa_part_pool`,
  `argmax_partials`, `fa_vf16_scratch`) that are single-stream-safe by design, and the
  same-device pipelined placement runs two stage streams through concurrently. A race whose
  window closed on different silicon is still a race — clocks, kernel durations, and SM
  counts differ, and this box's cards are *idle-clocked at P8 between runs*. Absence of
  failure in 20 runs is **not** absence of the unsound surface. Wrong-logits-fast stays
  un-shipped.
- **It DOES change the risk picture for the arm this lane actually needs.** The cross-device
  pipelined arm — one device per stage, which is exactly the PP-2-on-a-pair serving shape —
  now carries **40/40 clean on target silicon** on top of the H100's ~189/190. The single
  H100 cross-device flake remains recorded evidence that the mechanism is reachable
  cross-device at low probability; nothing here refutes it (80 runs cannot see a 0.5% event
  with confidence — P(0 failures | p=0.005, n=80) = 0.67, so this soak is simply not
  powered to detect it). **Honest statement: the cross-device flake is neither reproduced
  nor excluded; the same-device 35% rate IS excluded.**
- **Consequence for the bill:** the deferred-pipelined arm (the 1.87x prize) is still not
  serving-default-cleared, and this lane does not clear it. But the blocker is now
  explicitly a *root-cause* requirement (fix the shared-Engine scratch surface, or prove per
  stage-stream isolation), not "we don't know if it happens on our hardware."

### Why the flake window likely differs here (mechanism note, not a claim)

The M2 bisect found `MEMRA_PDL=0` went 20/20 clean and PDL narrowed but did not eliminate
the window — i.e. programmatic dependent launch widens the race. PDL's early-launch overlap
scales with how long a kernel's tail leaves the SMs partly idle, and both the SM count
(H100 SXM 132 vs PRO 6000's Blackwell config) and the per-kernel durations at q9's shape
differ. A narrower window on this silicon is consistent with the recorded mechanism. Not
measured here; recorded so nobody reads "20/20 clean" as "the bug was H100-specific."

---

## Phase 2 — the serving bill

### Item 1: P2P transport arm — **CLOSED, already shipped** (Phase 0 receipt)

The task brief asked to "wire/enable the direct-copy arm in pp.rs where the host-staged path
exists." **There is no host-staged path in `pp.rs` to replace.** `PpNRt::tx` (pp.rs:569)
selects transport per boundary: `memcpy_dtod` when the boundary is same-device, and
`cudarc::driver::result::memcpy_peer_async` with explicit src/dst contexts when it crosses.
Peer access + `cuMemPoolSetAccess` are granted between every distinct device pair at
`PpNRt::build`. On this pair `canAccessPeer` is 1 both ways, so the cross arm is live and is
what all 13 Phase-1 gates and all 80 cross-device soak runs exercised. Measured advantage
over the bounce a non-P2P box would need: **13-14x at boundary payload** (Phase 0 table).
No work item. Note for the record: the host-staged bounce in issue-#67 class was a *5090*
problem, and the correct conclusion is that it never needs building for owned PRO 6000
hardware.

### Item 2: batched decode over PP-2 — **the real finding: the door is not unwired, it is
### SILENTLY WRONG-SHAPED (fails open, not closed)**

The assessment and the `pp.rs` header both say batch/dc/graph/spec are "unwired" and that
`warn_unwired_once` fires. **Both are wrong about the batch path.** Ground truth from the
source:

- `warn_unwired_once` has exactly **two** call sites, and both are gemma4-specific:
  `decode.rs:615` (gemma4-e4b eager) and `hybrid_forward.rs:6462` (gemma4 eager N>2).
  **Neither is on the batched path.**
- `decode_step_batch`'s only pp-awareness is `decode_batch.rs:361` — `pp_cuts(...).is_none()`
  as one condition among six gating the **B=1 fast path**. Its effect is the opposite of a
  guard: with the pp door open it *disables* the B=1 fast path and falls through into the
  batched body, which then runs the **entire trunk** (`for (il, layer) in
  self.layers.iter().enumerate()`, decode_batch.rs:514, `lo=0..n_layers`) on the **primary
  engine's stream**, with no stage split, no boundary, and no `rt.enter()`.
- Under `MEMRA_PP_DEVICES=0,1` with sharding on (the default), stage 1's weights **are on
  dev1**. So the batched body dereferences dev1 weights from a dev0 kernel — legal, because
  `PpNRt::build` granted peer + pool access — and every projection for the back half of the
  model streams over PCIe per step.

**Probe result (`logs/batchprobe/`, `run-pp2-batchprobe.sh`): every arm PASSES.**

| `decode-batch-gate` arm (q9, 32 steps, --mode config) | gate1 | gate2 | gate3 |
|---|---|---|---|
| door SHUT B=4 (baseline) | PASS (0/6 early draws) | PASS | PASS |
| door OPEN `stages=2` singledev B=4 | PASS | PASS | PASS |
| **door OPEN `stages=2` dev01 SHARDED B=4** | **PASS** | **PASS** | **PASS** |
| door OPEN dev01 B=1 | PASS | PASS | PASS |

**This is the dangerous answer.** Peer reads return identical bytes, so exactness is
genuinely preserved — the gates are not lying, and there is no correctness bug to fix. But
that means:

1. **Nothing fails, warns, or refuses.** A serving deployment that opens the pp door and
   serves batched traffic gets *silently* the worst of both worlds: half the weights read
   over PCIe every step, zero pipeline parallelism, and a green exactness battery. The
   quarantine discipline that protects the pipelined arm (a loud `Err` with a full
   explanation, decode.rs:977) has **no counterpart on the batch path**.
2. **The docs understate the bill in one direction and overstate it in another.** Batched
   decode over PP-2 is not "an arm that doesn't exist yet and errors if you try" — it is an
   arm that *runs*, passes gates, and quietly costs performance. That is worse than unwired.
3. **The fix has two halves and they are not the same size.** (a) A refusal — make
   `decode_step_batch` fail closed under an open pp door with device placement, matching the
   pipelined arm's precedent. Small, mechanical, gate-able today. (b) The actual wiring —
   stage-split the batched trunk. That is the weeks-class item, and it is real work:
   `decode_step_batch`'s body is a single 250-line `lo=0..n_layers` loop over a
   pointer-table (`lin_base`/`attn_base`, built once for all B across all layers,
   decode_batch.rs:447-500) plus a batched `pos_d` vector; splitting it means per-stage
   pointer tables, per-stage `pos_d`, an `[B, n_embd]` boundary (16 KB x B — where the
   Phase-0 bidir 105 GB/s number starts to matter), and per-stage engines threaded through
   ~15 `e.` call sites. The eager arm got a clean `decode_layers_eager(e, x, lo, hi, ...)`
   seam to reuse; **the batched body has no equivalent `lo..hi` helper** — that extraction is
   the first increment of any real wiring.

#### Cost of the silent peer-read — MEASURED

`decode-batch-bench`, q9, 32 prompt / 128 gen, four arms **interleaved rep-major N=5**
(driver `run-pp2-batchcost.sh`, receipts `logs/batchcost/`, one log per rep per arm).
Medians, aggregate tok/s across the batch:

| arm | B=1 | B=4 | B=8 | vs door-shut |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A door SHUT (single-GPU baseline) | 208.9 | 491.3 | 657.0 | 1.00x |
| B door OPEN `stages=2` singledev | 178.5 | 491.2 | 655.7 | 0.854x / 1.000x / 0.998x |
| **C door OPEN `stages=2` dev01 SHARDED** | **7.4** | **29.8** | **47.4** | **0.035x / 0.061x / 0.072x** |
| D door OPEN `stages=2` dev01 `SHARD=0` | 178.5 | 491.1 | 656.6 | 0.854x / 1.000x / 0.999x |

Run-to-run spread ≤0.63% on every cell (most ≤0.35%), so these are not noisy numbers.

Three reads, all of which the refusal recommendation rests on:

1. **The real serving shape (arm C) costs 28x at B=1 and 14x at B=8.** 7.4 tok/s aggregate
   for a 9B model on two PRO 6000s. Every projection for layers 32..63 is fetched over
   PCIe *per batched step*, and there is no pipeline overlap to hide it because the trunk
   runs as one unsplit loop on the primary stream.
2. **Arm D isolates the cause exactly.** Same open door, same two devices, only
   `MEMRA_PP_SHARD=0` (all weights home on the primary) — and it is bit-for-bit the same
   throughput as arm B/singledev (178.5 / 491.1 / 656.6). So the entire 28x is the
   **peer read of stage-1 weights**, not the door, not the placement plumbing, not the
   `pp::new_cache` stage-owned KV. This matches M2's H100 finding that unsharded
   peer-read weight placement is a 3-4x cliff — on this pair, at batch, it is a 14-28x
   cliff, because PCIe Gen5 x16 (56 GB/s) against 96 GB HBM bandwidth is a far worse
   ratio than NVLink was.
3. **The `-15%` at B=1 in arms B/D is the lost fast path, and it is the door's only
   *visible* effect.** 178.5 vs 208.9 = the `decode_step_b1_fast` bypass that
   `decode_batch.rs:361` disables. At B>=4 it vanishes (491.2 vs 491.3) because the
   batched body is what runs in both cases. So a well-placed operator who opens the door
   with `SHARD=0` sees only a 15% B=1 regression and nothing else — no warning that PP
   is not happening at all.

**Recommendation, now with numbers: `decode_step_batch` must fail closed under an open pp
door with multi-device placement.** The pipelined arm refuses its unsound config with a
full `Err` (decode.rs:977) plus a measurement override; the batch path has no counterpart
and silently delivers 3.5% of baseline. Shipped as a code change this lane — see Item 4.

### Item 3: the eager PP-2 throughput story on a PRO 6000 pair — **the 1.87x transfers, and it is 1.91x here**

`ppn-bench`, 32 prompt / 128 gen, N=5 reps interleaved rep-major in-process. Two
invocations per model because **the pp door is a load-time decision** (a sharded load
timed as a "baseline" would time peer-reads — the bench's own header law): invocation 1 =
door shut, unsharded, `serial-off`; invocation 2 = `MEMRA_PP_STAGES=2
MEMRA_PP_DEVICES=0,1`, which interleaves `serial-pp` and `pipelined-pp`. Both under
`flock /tmp/memra-gpu.lock`. Driver `run-pp2-eagerbench.sh`, receipts `logs/eagerbench/`.
Cards went 180 MHz/30 W idle to 2400/2317 MHz, 266/291 W (`gpu-pre.csv`/`gpu-post.csv`) —
full-power regime, box otherwise empty of compute apps.

| model | baseline (door shut, 1 GPU) | serial-pp dev01 | pipelined-pp dev01 | serial vs base | **pipelined vs base** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| q9 (Qwen3.5-9B-NVFP4-MTP, 32L, 5.7 GB) | 211.77 tok/s | 210.10 | **378.18** | 0.992x | **1.786x** |
| q27 (Qwen3.6-27B-NVFP4-Q4_K_M-mtp, 64L, 15.7 GB) | 76.03 tok/s | 75.73 | **144.82** | 0.996x | **1.905x** |

Spread is tight (q27 pipelined: all 5 reps inside 0.5 us/tok, 0.007%). Fences: q9
`[0,16,32]`, q27 `[0,32,64]`. Both door-open logs carry the cross-device transport line
(`cudaMemcpyPeerAsync per cross boundary; ... weight home: per-stage (sharded loader)`).

Reads:

1. **The M2 prize transfers to PCIe P2P silicon, and improves with model depth.** H100
   SXM/NVSwitch measured 1.87x at N=2 on q9; this pair does 1.786x on q9 and **1.905x on
   q27**. The *bigger* model winning more is the expected shape — the boundary copy is a
   fixed ~7 us against a per-stage compute half that grows with layer count, so the
   overlap fraction improves. It also confirms the Phase-0 verdict under load: at these
   payloads the interconnect is not the limiter, and NVLink's absence costs ~nothing here.
2. **Serial cross-device PP-2 is free (0.99x both models)** — reproducing M2's H100 result
   and M0's 0.3-0.5%/tick prediction on new silicon. So the pure *capacity* use of PP-2
   (fit a model that does not fit one card) costs ~0.4% of single-card decode. That is the
   number the 192 GB listing decision needs, now measured on the target pair.
3. **Ceiling check.** 1.905x is near the structural max for a 2-stage split with
   tokens-in-flight 3 (each stage busy ~half the serial tick), so little is left in *this*
   mechanism at N=2 — and M2 already showed N=4/8 do not add single-stream speed.

**The caveat that governs how this number may be used** (recorded because the M2 write-up
does not state it and the 192 GB assessment repeats "1.87x" unqualified): the deferred
window is measured on a **pre-recorded greedy token stream**. `ppn-bench` and `ppn-gate`
both replay an `inputs` vector captured from a door-off reference run, so step t+1 is
enqueued before step t's logits are read back. **Plain autoregressive serving cannot do
that** — it needs token t to pick token t+1. So 1.905x is not a free speedup for
single-stream greedy serving; it is the pipeline's throughput *when something supplies the
next token early*. What legitimately supplies it: **speculative/MTP decode** (draft tokens
are known ahead, and the artifact already carries an MTP head), **batched/multi-sequence
serving** (independent sequences fill the window), and prefill. Single-stream greedy gets
the *serial* 0.996x row, not the pipelined row. This does not weaken the result — it names
which serving modes monetize it, and both are the remaining bill items. It does mean the
deferred arm's value is **gated behind spec-over-PP2 or batch-over-PP2**, on top of its
existing root-cause quarantine.

## Cohabitation with the step37-p2 lane (coordinator directive 2026-08-06)

The box is shared with the Step-3.7-Flash bring-up lane (owner doctrine: 3.7-Flash serves on
this pair over PP-2). Rules honored on my side:

- **Tree isolation:** my work is confined to `~/memra`, `~/receipts/pp2`, and
  `/scratch-models`. `~/step37` is not touched.
- **GPU lock:** every measurement window from the eagerbench onward runs under
  `flock /tmp/memra-gpu.lock`. The reason is not courtesy — an interleaved A/B whose arms
  straddle another lane's model load is a cross-run comparison, which this repo's H100 LAWS
  forbid outright. `run-pp2-eagerbench.sh` carries the wrapper plus an in-script comment so
  the next hand does not drop it.
- **Contention actually observed: none.** `nvidia-smi --query-compute-apps` was empty before
  and after every window in this report, and the cards idled at P8/30 W immediately before
  the eagerbench. Every receipt here is window-clean.
- **Disk:** root went 74 GB to **128 GB of 387 GB used (34%, 259 GB free)** while `~/step37`
  grew to 54 GB en route to ~105 GB. Headroom is fine for both lanes (my models total 21 GB
  and are already staged), but a *third* lane staging a 100 GB-class artifact would not fit.
  Flagged per directive; not blocking.

## Item 4: the refusal — **SHIPPED with a gate** (code change, not a recommendation)

`decode_step_batch` now **fails closed** when the ppN door is open across 2+ distinct
devices with the sharded loader on. Three pieces:

- **`pp.rs::pp_sharded_cross_device()`** — env-only predicate (open door AND `MEMRA_PP_SHARD`
  not 0 AND `MEMRA_PP_DEVICES` naming 2+ distinct devices), i.e. exactly "some layers' weights
  live on a device other than the primary". Deliberately NOT the same predicate as
  `pp_multi_stream_same_device()`: that one guards a *race*, this one guards a *cliff*, and
  their true-sets are near-complements (`0,0` is unsafe for the pipelined arm and fine here;
  `0,1` is the reverse).
- **`decode_batch.rs`** — refusal at the top of `decode_step_batch_sampled_lean_masked`, with
  the measured numbers, the three escapes, and the receipt path inline in the `Err` string, so
  an operator who trips it does not need to find this file.
  `MEMRA_PP_ALLOW_UNSPLIT_BATCH=1` overrides for measurement (the batchcost arm above must
  stay reproducible).
- **`pp.rs` module header + `docs/FLAGS.md`** — the "`warn_unwired_once` fires" claim for
  batch/dc/graph/spec is corrected in place, since that sentence is what made the fail-open
  behavior look accounted-for.

### Gate battery for the refusal (`logs/refusal/`, driver `run-pp2-refusal.sh`)

Both halves gated: it fires where it must, and it does not fire anywhere else.

| # | Config | Expected | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | door SHUT | PASS | **gate1+2+3 PASS**, 0/6 early draws |
| 2 | door OPEN `stages=2`, no placement (singledev) | PASS — not cross-device | **gate1+2+3 PASS** |
| 3 | door OPEN `stages=2 devices=0,1` SHARDED | **REFUSE** | **exit=1, full `Err` text** |
| 4 | #3 + `MEMRA_PP_SHARD=0` (documented escape) | PASS | **gate1+2+3 PASS** |
| 5 | #3 + `MEMRA_PP_ALLOW_UNSPLIT_BATCH=1` (override) | PASS | **gate1+2+3 PASS** |
| 6 | door OPEN `devices=0,0` (repeated device) | PASS — same-device, nothing remote | **gate1+2+3 PASS** |
| 7 | regression: `ppn-gate` N=2 dev01 (the eager pp arm) | untouched | **PASS BIT-IDENTICAL both arms**, 48 steps |
| 8 | regression: `kernel-check` | untouched | **ALL GREEN**, 0 FAIL lines |

Arm 6 is the one that would catch an over-broad predicate (`0,0` names two devices textually
but places nothing remotely); arm 5 keeps this lane's own measurement reproducible; arm 7
proves the change did not leak into the arm that actually works.

**What this does and does not fix.** It converts a silent 28x into a loud error with three
named escapes — that is the whole claim. It does **not** make batched decode work over PP-2;
that remains the weeks-class item below. The value is that a serving deployment can no longer
reach 3.5% of baseline with a green battery, which is the failure mode this box was rented to
find.

### Item 4b: the audit found FOUR paths with the same hole — the guard is now shared

After shipping the batch refusal I audited the other paths the docs called "unwired", and
the answer is worse than the batch finding alone: **`grep -c 'pp_cuts\|pp::'` returns 0 for
`spec.rs`, `graph_update.rs`, and `prime_graph.rs`.** Not "wired incorrectly" — literally
zero pp-awareness. Every one of them walks `for (il, layer) in self.layers.iter()` on a
single stream:

| path | trunk walk | pp-awareness before this lane |
|---|---|---|
| `decode_step_batch` | `decode_batch.rs:514` | one term that DISABLED the B=1 fast path |
| `decode_step_dc` (device-counter decode) | `decode.rs:1277` | none |
| `decode_step_dc_cap*` (graph capture) | captures the dc chain | none |
| `decode_step_t_core_stream` (spec verify) | `spec.rs:1359` | none |

So the same 28x cliff was reachable through four doors, three of which nothing in the repo
had noticed. The fix is one helper, `pp::refuse_unsplit_if_remote(path, alt)`, called from
each — deliberately **not** four copies, because a per-path copy is precisely how the next
path added gets missed. Each call site passes its own `alt` string so the error names the
working alternative for *that* loop (eager pp arm for dc; "stage-split the batched trunk
first" for spec, since verify is a batched T=K+1 forward).

Placement notes worth keeping:

- **`decode_step_dc`'s guard sits BEFORE the gemma4 delegate**, because the gemma4 dc twin
  has the same unsplit shape.
- **The spec guard is on `decode_step_t_core_stream`, the funnel**, not on the five public
  wrappers (`decode_step_t`, `_h`, `_h_emb`, `_h_emb_dev`, `_core`) — all of them land
  there, so a future wrapper inherits the guard instead of forgetting it.
- **Graph and spec coverage turned out to be transitive**, and the gate proved it rather
  than assuming it: both `graph-decode-gate` and `run-spec` refuse with
  `"decode_step_dc: refused ..."` — the graph path captures the dc chain, and spec's draft
  loop reaches dc before verify. The verify guard is still worth having (a spec arm that
  bypassed dc would otherwise be silently uncovered), but the *observed* refusal comes from
  dc in both cases. Recording which guard actually fires, since a future refactor that
  moves dc out of those paths would silently drop their protection.

#### Gate battery, 12 arms (`logs/refusal2/`, driver `run-pp2-refusal2.sh`)

| # | Path / config | Expected | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| dc-1 | `decode-dc-gate` door shut | PASS | **PASS BIT-IDENTICAL**, 256 steps, buckets=5 |
| dc-2 | `decode-dc-gate` dev01 sharded | **REFUSE** | **exit=1** `decode_step_dc: refused ...` |
| dc-3 | dc-2 + `ALLOW_UNSPLIT_BATCH=1` | PASS | **PASS BIT-IDENTICAL**, 256 steps |
| dc-4 | dc-2 + `MEMRA_PP_SHARD=0` | PASS | **PASS BIT-IDENTICAL**, 256 steps |
| gr-1 | `graph-decode-gate` door shut | PASS | **PASS BIT-IDENTICAL**, 256 steps, buckets=13 captures=2 |
| gr-2 | `graph-decode-gate` dev01 sharded | **REFUSE** | **exit=1** (refuses at dc — transitive) |
| sp-1 | `run-spec` K=4 door shut | PASS | **self-consistency PASS all 4 rounds** (82.4/53.1/52.8/41.7% acceptance) |
| sp-2 | `run-spec` K=4 dev01 sharded | **REFUSE** | **exit=1** (refuses at dc — transitive) |
| sp-3 | sp-2 + `ALLOW_UNSPLIT_BATCH=1` | PASS | **self-consistency PASS all 4 rounds**, identical acceptance to sp-1 |
| rg-1 | `ppn-gate` N=2 dev01 | untouched | **PASS BIT-IDENTICAL** serial + pipelined |
| rg-2 | `run-gen` door shut | untouched | **MATCH** argmax=561 |
| rg-3 | `decode-batch-gate` door shut | untouched | **gate1+2+3 PASS** |

`sp-3` vs `sp-1` is the arm that proves the override is exactly a door and not a behavior
change: identical acceptance rates (14/17, 17/32, 19/36, 20/48) and identical
self-consistency verdicts with the guard bypassed. Combined with Item 4's 8 arms, the
fail-closed change is gated on **20 arms across 5 binaries, 0 unexpected results**.

## What is left of the PP-2 serving bill

Ordered by what a serving deployment on this pair actually needs:

1. **Stage-split the batched trunk** (weeks-class, the real item). `decode_step_batch`'s body
   is one `lo=0..n_layers` loop over pointer tables (`lin_base`/`attn_base`, built once for all
   B across all layers, `decode_batch.rs:447-500`) plus a batched `pos_d`. Splitting it needs
   per-stage pointer tables, per-stage `pos_d`, an `[B, n_embd]` boundary (16 KB x B — where
   Phase 0's 105 GB/s bidir number starts to matter, and where the P2P-vs-bounce gap becomes
   structural rather than noise), and per-stage engines threaded through ~15 `e.` call sites.
   **First increment: extract a `decode_batch_layers(e, .., lo, hi, ..)` seam.** The eager arm
   had `decode_layers_eager` to reuse; the batched body has no equivalent, and every later
   increment depends on that extraction.
2. **Root-cause the shared-Engine scratch race** — the only thing between the deferred arm and
   a serving default. Named surface: `Engine`'s lazily-grown stable-pointer pools
   (`fa_part_pool`, `argmax_partials`, `fa_vf16_scratch`) are single-stream-safe by design and
   the pipelined arm runs 2+ stage streams through them. Either isolate per stage-stream or
   prove they cannot alias. This lane refuted the H100 *rate* (20/20 forced-clean, p<0.001) but
   an unsound surface is not a fixed one, and 80 runs cannot see a 0.5% event.
3. **Spec/MTP over PP-2** — brief, not built (Item 5 below). This is the arm that *monetizes*
   the 1.905x, because draft tokens are the legitimate way to fill the deferred window in
   single-stream serving.
4. ~~**dc/graph over PP-2** — fail-closed treatment~~ **DONE this lane (Item 4b)**: dc,
   graph capture, and spec verify all now refuse. What remains for these three is the same
   as for batch — actually *splitting* them, which for dc/graph means a per-stage captured
   subgraph per boundary (graph capture across two devices' streams is its own research
   question, not a wiring job) and for spec means item 3.
5. **`build.rs` nvcc resolution** — resolve from `PATH`/`CUDA_HOME` before the pinned
   `/usr/local/cuda-13.1`. Cost me the first build on this box; will cost the next lane too.

### Item 5: spec/MTP over PP-2 — the brief (not built, per "don't sink days")

Why it is the highest-value remaining perf item and not just another wiring job: the deferred
window's 1.905x needs token t+1 enqueued before token t's logits land, which plain
autoregressive decode structurally cannot do — but speculative decode **already has** the next
K tokens (the draft proposes them). So spec-over-PP2 is the one arm where the measured 1.9x is
reachable in real single-stream serving. The artifact already carries an MTP head.

Shape of the work, in the order it has to happen:

1. **Draft placement decision.** The MTP/NextN layers map to the LAST stage today
   (`pp::new_cache`'s trailing-layer rule). For spec that means the draft runs on stage N-1
   while the verify trunk starts on stage 0 — a full boundary hop per draft token, but also
   natural draft/verify overlap on two devices. The alternative (draft on stage 0) makes
   drafting local but serializes against the trunk. **Neither is measured; this is the
   experiment, not a foregone conclusion.**
2. **Verify is a batched forward of K+1 tokens** — so it lands on item 1 above. Spec-over-PP2
   cannot ship before the batched trunk is stage-split. That ordering is the point of this
   brief: item 1 is not optional infrastructure, it is spec's prerequisite.
3. **Rollback/accept state crosses stages.** Accept length is decided at the last stage (where
   the lm head is) but rollback touches every stage's KV. Today's spec loop assumes one engine
   owns all caches. Needs a stage-fan-out accept/rollback, event-ordered like `tx`/`rx`.
4. **Gate before perf, as always:** `run-spec` K=1..8 self-consistency over the door, plus a
   PP-2-vs-1-GPU accepted-token-stream identity check. A spec arm that changes acceptance is
   changing math, not scheduling.

Estimated shape: item 1 is the bulk; given a `decode_batch_layers` seam, spec's own PP wiring
is days, not weeks. Not started this lane.

## Phase 1b — the DAILY model gated too: q27 over PP-2, **GREEN**

Phase 1 used q9 deliberately (same vehicle M1/M2 were minted on = cross-rig comparable).
But the model that would actually serve on this pair is the 27B, and its shape differs in
ways the gates care about: **64 layers instead of 32** (fence `[0,32,64]`, so twice the
per-stage depth), a different quant mix (NVFP4 + Q4_K_M), and a trailing MTP head that
`pp::new_cache` maps to the last stage. Receipts `logs/q27gate/`, driver
`run-pp2-q27gate.sh`, all under the shared GPU lock.

| Gate | Config | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| `ppn-gate` N=2 **dev01** | serial + pipelined | **PASS BIT-IDENTICAL** both arms, 48 steps, fence [0,32,64] |
| `ppn-gate` N=2 **dev10** (reversed) | serial + pipelined | **PASS BIT-IDENTICAL** both arms |
| `ppn-gate` N=2 singledev | serial | **PASS BIT-IDENTICAL** (pipelined quarantine-skipped, as designed) |
| `run-gen` door SHUT | 16 prompt / 8 gen | **MATCH** `prefill argmax=220 decode argmax=220` |
| `run-gen` door OPEN `stages=2 devices=0,1` | 16/8 | **MATCH** `prefill argmax=220 decode argmax=220` — *identical argmax to the door-shut run* |

48 steps x 248,320 f32 logits per arm, every bit compared against the door-off reference.
The two `run-gen` rows are the end-to-end statement the serving decision needs: the daily
model generates the **same tokens** whether it runs on one card or split across two, and its
`logit maxdiff` vs the internal reference is byte-for-byte the same value (2.457e-1) in both
— i.e. PP-2 introduces exactly zero additional deviation, not merely a small one.

**With this, PP-2 exactness on the target pair is gated on both the comparison vehicle (q9)
and the deployment vehicle (q27), in both placement orders.** The 192 GB assessment's
mandatory-before-listing item is discharged for the model that would ship.

## Lane summary (2026-08-06)

**Commits** (branch `lane/pp2-hardening`, off `restructure/public-split` @ 4b4dc7b1):

| hash | what |
|---|---|
| `816bdf47` | Phase 0 — box provisioned, P2P transport verdict measured |
| `2a0e2d48` | Phase 1 — 13-arm PP gate battery green, first ever on a PRO 6000 pair |
| `7b5cbebc` | the H100 35% same-device flake does not reproduce (20/20 forced, p<0.001) |
| `37dd6586` | the batch path FAILS OPEN (the finding) |
| `5fa3193a` | 1.905x deferred-pipelined on q27 + the 28x batch cost measured |
| `5f011708` | `decode_step_batch` fails closed (the fix) |
| `3980562e` | q27 exactness gated — the deployment model, both placements |
| `c9910eca` | the same hole in dc / graph / spec verify, one shared guard |

**Bill status:** transport CLOSED (already shipped, measured 13-14x over a bounce at
boundary payload). Exactness GREEN on both vehicles, both placements, N=2 and N=4.
Capacity PP-2 costs 0.4%. The 1.9x pipelined prize transfers but is gated behind
spec-or-batch over PP-2. Four fail-open paths now refuse. Remaining: stage-split the
batched trunk (weeks; spec's prerequisite), root-cause the shared-Engine scratch race,
then spec over PP-2.

**Not done / not claimed:** batched decode over PP-2 does not work — it refuses loudly
instead of silently costing 28x, which is a different and smaller claim. The cross-device
pipelined flake is neither reproduced nor excluded (80 runs cannot see a 0.5% event). No
runtime default moved, and per CLAUDE.md the 5090 remains the default-flip gate — nothing
here is a default-flip decision.
