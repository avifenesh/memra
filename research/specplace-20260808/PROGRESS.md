# specplace - placement-aware speculative serving policy

Lane: `lane/cx-spec-placement`, train `13f5ddb8`. Rig: box2
(`ubuntu@<box2-ip>`), 2x RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell Server 96 GB. Primary policy
model: q9 (`Qwen3.5-9B-NVFP4-MTP-GGUF.gguf`). Step35 is a PP-2 spot-check because
the merged batched step35 arm changed its plain-decode denominator to the
81/96/116/129-130 aggregate tok/s class at c=1/2/4/8.

`~/.lanectl/inbox/cx-specplace.md` was absent at lane start. The lane registry
does contain `cx-specplace` on this worktree with status `running`, but no lane
note was available.

## Question and decision rule

The scheduler currently uses one concurrency policy everywhere:

```
admit spec while active + 1 <= LOW=2
demote live spec at active >= HIGH=4
```

That policy was calibrated on one 5090. PP-2 has a different execution shape:
the draft chain remains a serial queue while plain decode uses batched,
stage-split execution.

Decision rule fixed before new measurements:

1. If PP-2 spec OFF wins every q9 cell by a non-close margin, default PP-2 to
   never admit spec. Keep `MEMRA_SPEC_GATE=0` as the always-spec rollback seam
   and keep explicit LOW/HIGH overrides available.
2. If PP-2 spec wins only at c=1, use PP-2 defaults LOW=1/HIGH=2.
3. If any policy-boundary cell is close, do not flip a default; publish a
   verdict-class report.
4. Single-card keeps the existing gate unless the same-train re-sweep refutes
   its c=1/c=2 win.

For this lane, "close" means the N=3+ arm medians overlap by run spread or the
winner is under 5%. Existing PP-2 deltas are 2x-5x, so they are not close.

## q9 decision matrix

Aggregate output tok/s, greedy. `S` forces the pure spec path with
`MEMRA_SPEC_GATE=0`; `N` forces plain batched serving with
`MEMRA_SERVE_SPEC=0`.

| placement | c | S spec ON | N spec OFF | S/N | current verdict | receipt / status |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|---|
| PP-2 dev10 | 1 | 112.5 | 223.3 | 0.50x | OFF wins | `research/pp2spec-crash-20260807/PROGRESS.md`, perf section, N=3; corroborated post-v0.72 fix at 111.9 vs 221.7 |
| PP-2 dev10 | 2 | 112.3 | 340.3 | 0.33x | OFF wins | same receipt, N=5; spec corroborated post-v0.72 fix at 111.9, N=3 |
| PP-2 dev10 | 4 | 112.1 | 593.4 | 0.19x | OFF wins | same receipt, N=5; #87 post-fix crash arm remains 111.5-111.6 |
| single card | 1 | 374.8 | 224.5 | 1.67x | ON wins | current train `d2a52fe6`, N=3, ranges 371.2-375.9 vs 223.8-224.6 |
| single card | 2 | 374.5 | 347.5 | 1.08x | ON wins | current train, N=3, ranges 370.5-378.8 vs 346.2-348.2: no overlap |
| single card | 4 | 377.3 | 617.1 | 0.61x | OFF wins | current train, N=3, ranges 369.4-377.6 vs 612.2-617.9 |

The PP-2 cells are already filled by same-rig, interleaved receipts and are
large-margin results and were cited instead of re-measured. The current-train
single-card re-sweep satisfies the stale-verdict law: absolute throughput moved,
but the crossover remains between c=2 and c=4. Even the narrow c=2 cell clears
the 5% bar and has no run-range overlap.

## Step35 PP-2 spot-check

Both arms were re-measured because the inherited step35 plain receipt used a
sampled load while the policy surface is greedy:

| c | spec ON | spec OFF | S/N | verdict |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| 1 | 35.9 (35.8-35.9) | 85.7 (85.7-85.7) | 0.42x | OFF wins |
| 2 | 36.2 (36.2-36.3) | 101.6 (101.5-101.6) | 0.36x | OFF wins |
| 4 | 36.7 (36.7-36.7) | 121.7 (121.5-122.0) | 0.30x | OFF wins |

All cells are N=3 medians on current train `d2a52fe6`. Forced-spec logs contain
104 `[spec-acc]` lines per rep; forced-plain logs contain zero and show the new
`[step35-batch] first B>1` arm, so the comparison exercised the intended paths.

Step35 cannot be a single-card placement cell: the 105 GB trunk is a PP-2
capacity artifact. Its role here is to check that PP-2's policy verdict survives
the newly merged batched denominator on the launch architecture.

## Measurement verdict

**Decisive default flip: PP-2 defaults to spec OFF. Single-card keeps LOW=2,
HIGH=4.**

- q9 PP-2: OFF wins every inherited cell, including 2.0x at c=1.
- step35 PP-2 on the current batched core: OFF wins 2.39x at c=1, 2.80x at c=2,
  and 3.32x at c=4.
- No PP-2 cell is close under the pre-declared rule.
- Single-card still has a real spec win at c=1/c=2 and a decisive loss at c=4,
  so changing its policy would discard measured throughput.

Implementation target: placement-aware gate defaults. Sharded cross-device PP
uses LOW=0/HIGH=1 (never admit spec); single-card keeps LOW=2/HIGH=4. Explicit
`MEMRA_SPEC_GATE_LOW`/`_HIGH` values override those defaults, and
`MEMRA_SPEC_GATE=0` remains the rollback to always-spec on every placement.

## Implementation

`crates/memra-server/src/worker.rs` now resolves the gate thresholds from the
actual serving placement:

- exactly two stages plus a sharded cross-device placement: LOW=0/HIGH=1;
- single-card, PP-N, same-device PP, and sharding/stream rollback shapes:
  LOW=2/HIGH=4, because this lane did not measure those as PP-2 policy cells;
- explicit LOW/HIGH values override the placement defaults, with the existing
  loud `HIGH <= LOW` clamp retained;
- `MEMRA_SPEC_GATE=0` still bypasses admission and demotion and therefore forces
  the always-spec rollback arm.

The placement-default PP-2 process also stops charging
`SPEC_SHRINK_RESERVE`: with LOW=0 no request can enter spec, so plain admission
keeps its prior headroom rule. A startup line records placement, resolved
thresholds, source, and whether spec admission is on or off.

Operator docs were synchronized in README, `docs/SERVING.md`,
`docs/PERFORMANCE.md`, `docs/FLAGS.md`, `docs/DRAFT-REGIME.md`, and
`docs/HY3-SPILL.md`. No generated perf block or published number changed.

Local GPU-free checks:

- `cargo test -p memra-server -- --test-threads=1`: 119 passed, 0 failed;
- `python3 tools/update-perf-board.py --check`: up to date;
- `git diff --check`: clean.

## Gate attempt 1

Receipt: `gates/20260808T104600Z/`, exact source commit `b6afdcc7`.

The live checks all completed:

- run-spec K=1..8: 8/8 on single-card, PP-2 dev10, and PP-2 dev01;
- naked PP-2: LOW=0/HIGH=1 logged, 4/4 complete, no `[spec-acc]`;
- naked single-card: LOW=2/HIGH=4 logged, 4/4 complete, spec live;
- #87 quick forced-spec sequence: c=2 8/8, c=4 16/16, recovery c=1
  4/4, no illegal-address or argmax-sentinel line;
- `tools/serve-smoke.sh`: 0 failed (optional Gemma arm skipped because that
  artifact is absent on box2).

The first receipt is not the final clean gate. Immediately after
`[server] drain complete in 0.0s; exiting`, its forced-spec server logged:

```
[worker] spec pending flush failed (DriverError(CUDA_ERROR_DEINITIALIZED, "<Failure when calling cuGetErrorString()>")); dropping session
```

All load rows, including recovery, had already completed, but evidence
discipline does not discard a captured error because it followed SIGTERM. The
gate now waits for `serve_idle_seconds >= 0.5` before shutdown and rejects
`CUDA_ERROR_DEINITIALIZED` or `spec pending flush failed`; a full rerun is
required.

## Final gate battery

Clean receipt: `gates/20260808T105800Z/`, exact source commit `8d8ba1ea`.
GPU window: 2026-08-08 11:03:00Z-11:04:29Z. Both cards were at 0 MiB
and the compute-process lists were empty at entry and exit. The window began
warm after another locked lane; these are correctness/liveness gates, not
performance medians.

| gate | result |
|---|---|
| run-spec single-card | K=1..8, 8/8 self-consistency PASS |
| run-spec PP-2 dev10 | K=1..8, 8/8 self-consistency PASS |
| run-spec PP-2 dev01 | K=1..8, 8/8 self-consistency PASS |
| naked PP-2 policy | LOW=0/HIGH=1, admission OFF, 4/4 complete, 0 spec lines |
| naked single-card policy | LOW=2/HIGH=4, admission ON, 4/4 complete, 13 spec lines |
| #87 quick, forced spec | c=2 8/8, c=4 16/16, recovery c=1 4/4; 85 spec lines |
| #87 error scan | no illegal-address, deinitialized, trap, sentinel, pending-flush, Xid 31, page-table fault, panic, or abort line |
| serve-smoke | 0 failed; optional Gemma arm skipped because its artifact is absent |

The policy/crash servers each reported at least 0.5 seconds of worker idle
before SIGTERM. All five load rows had zero errors and zero sheds. The PP-2
default liveness point was 221.8 aggregate tok/s and the single-card default
point was 377.4; these are single gate points, not new benchmark cells. Artifact
and binary hashes are retained in the receipt.

## Measurement protocol

- One exclusive `/tmp/memra-gpu.lock` hold per sweep.
- Current lane commit transferred without an origin push; clean release build on
  box2.
- q9 single-card: S/N, c=1/2/4, N=3+, rep-major interleaving, greedy,
  identical prompt and token budget.
- Step35 PP-2: forced S/N at c=1/2/4, N=3, because the inherited N receipt was
  sampled rather than greedy.
- Raw server logs, load JSONL, build provenance, GPU pre/post state, medians,
  run spread, and error counts land under `research/specplace-20260808/raw/`.
- No cross-day absolute comparison decides a close cell. Existing PP-2 cells
  are used only because their margins are far outside the close class and were
  repeated after the v0.72 head-affinity fix.

Actual window: one lock hold, 2026-08-08 10:18:40Z-10:30:32Z. Both GPUs were at
0 MiB on entry and exit; `nvidia-smi` reported no compute processes at either
boundary. Load points: 36, with 0 errors and 0 shed requests. Temperatures stayed
31-46 C during the sweep. Artifact and binary hashes are in
`raw/{artifact,binary}-sha256-20260808T101200Z.txt`.

## Required gates after any policy change

- `run-spec` K=1..8 on single card and PP-2.
- `tools/serve-smoke.sh`.
- #87 quick crash gate on PP-2 with `MEMRA_SPEC_GATE=0` so the default-off policy
  cannot hide the formerly fatal path.
- Default-policy boot evidence: PP-2 admits no spec; single-card still admits
  spec at low concurrency.
