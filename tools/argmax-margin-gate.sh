#
# WHY THIS GATE EXISTS (research/q8-argmax-20260806/VERDICT.md)
# ------------------------------------------------------------
# run-gen carries a hard assert: `forward_last` (batched prefill) and the `decode_step`
# tokenwise loop must produce the same last-position argmax, else "cache threading bug"
# (run_gen.rs:896). That assert is right to exist and its wording is a landmine: on the 27B
# Q8_0 + board-2048 pair it has been red on the 188-SM pod since at least v0.69.0, and there
# is no cache threading bug. The two configs are two legitimate arithmetics; the last
# position of that prompt happens to sit on a THREE-WAY near-tie (top-3 inside 0.05 on a
# logit scale whose median top-2 gap is 1.25), so the two configs pick differently. Proven by
# the f32 oracle (MEMRA_FAST=0) flipping the same pair — no fast kernel is involved — and by
# the same {332,485} pair firing on 3 silicon classes and 3 model sizes.
#
# THE COVERAGE BUG THIS GATE FIXES
# --------------------------------
# The assert inspects ONE position: the last. So which prompts "pass" is decided by whether
# their final token happens to land on a near-tie — luck of prompt length, not a property of
# the engine. Measured (research/q8-argmax-20260806/RESULTS.jsonl, arm P3): the 27B NVFP4 arm
# the release battery calls GREEN carries a config flip at position 2042 whose margin (0.0184)
# is SMALLER than the failing arm's (0.0307). Same mechanism, invisible, shipping green.
# Conversely a MATCH at maxdiff 1.165 (arm L4) sits beside a MISMATCH at 0.4659 — so the
# `logit maxdiff` the gate prints is NOT a severity signal and must never be read as one.
#
# WHAT THIS GATE ASSERTS INSTEAD
# ------------------------------
# Over the last N positions of a prompt, under both configs, for every position:
#   flip at position p  =>  margin(p) < config_delta(p)
# i.e. every prefill/decode argmax disagreement must be EXPLAINED by a top-2 margin the
# config spread can actually reach across. A flip at a WIDE margin is the real defect class
# (a genuine cache/threading/kernel bug moves a logit by more than the gap it crosses), and
# that is what fails here — at any position, not just the last. It additionally fails if the
# flip COUNT exceeds --max-flips (default 1): a near-tie coin is isolated by nature, while a
# broken kernel disagrees repeatedly.
#
# This turns an uncalibrated one-position assert into a calibrated all-position one, and it
# is strictly stronger: it catches the pos-2042 class the current gate sleeps through, while
# no longer red-flagging a 0.03-margin coin as a "cache threading bug".
#
# TEETH: --canary INJECTS A BREAK rather than relabelling an expectation (the trap documented
# in tools/chunk-invariance-gate.sh's header, learned the hard way on lane/chunkinv-flip).
# It runs the real probe, then FAULT-INJECTS into a copy of the measured table one row of the
# exact class this gate exists to catch — a WIDE-margin flip (margin 5.0 >> delta 0.1, i.e. a
# disagreement the config spread cannot possibly explain, the signature of a genuine
# cache/threading/kernel bug) — and requires the comparator to reject it. This is a mutation
# test of the comparator on its own parse path, so it fires regardless of whether the model
# under test happens to produce any natural flip.
#   Rejected canary designs, and why (both were tried on this lane):
#   (a) flip only the EXPECTED verdict -> re-runs the identical data, perfectly correlated
#       with the default gate, proves nothing (the chunkinv trap).
#   (b) raise a margin floor above the prompt's median -> only touches rows that ALREADY
#       flipped, so on a clean model (0 flips) there is nothing to reject and the canary
#       reports "no teeth". Correct behavior, useless as a teeth check.
