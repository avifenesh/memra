#
# WHY THIS GATE EXISTS (research/f8f4-flip-20260806/MATRIX.md, merged c506317e).
# A kernel-arm change (MEMRA_MMQ_F8F4=1) moved SERVED GREEDY TEXT in 4 of 6 regime cells at
# temperature 0 and moved spec acceptance by up to -9.5pp — and the whole battery stayed green:
#
#   1. The token goldens are 20 tokens. Both of that lane's greedy divergences landed at
#      generated index 22 and 38, i.e. PAST the pins. A 20-token golden is structurally
#      incapable of seeing a change that starts at token 22.
#   2. Worse, `fast-gate --refresh-goldens` after such a change would have silently RE-PINNED
#      the new arm's tokens — the gate would have absorbed the regression and then defended it.
#   3. Acceptance is invisible to every exactness gate BY CONSTRUCTION. Each arm is internally
#      self-consistent (run-spec PASSes both arms: spec output == plain output within an arm),
#      each arm reproduces its own goldens, and argmax MATCHes. Nothing in the battery compares
#      HOW MANY DRAFT TOKENS WERE ACCEPTED — which is spec throughput, i.e. the product.
#
# So this gate asserts the two properties the battery was blind to, at the serve config:
#
#   A. ACCEPTANCE COUNTS, EXACT. (rounds, drafted, accepted) must integer-match a pinned
#      reference. Not the rate, and not a tolerance band: at temperature 0 drafting is
#      deterministic, so these are hard integers, and a band would just relabel the blind spot
#      at a coarser grain. `accepted/drafted` is derived and reported for humans only.
#   B. THE FULL GENERATED TEXT, to ngen >= 100 tokens (default 128), sha256-pinned — 6.4x past
#      the 20-token window, and covering the exact indices (22, 38) the receipted divergences
#      landed at. Mismatch quotes the first differing character with context.
#
# WHAT MAKES A SINGLE-SHOT READ LEGITIMATE (inherited from the seed harness,
# research/f8f4-flip-20260806/tools/regime_accept_ab.sh): temperature 0 => drafting is
# deterministic => acceptance is a hard number, not a sample. That lane's OFF/ON/OFF2 protocol
# measured it: the two independent OFF passes (separate server boots, separate processes) were
# byte-identical in ALL SIX cells — same rounds/drafted/accepted, same text sha256. Acceptance
# here is a property of (build x model x drafter x prompt x K), not of the box's mood, so one
# pass is evidence. `--control` re-runs each cell in a SECOND server boot and asserts
# self-agreement, which is that OFF-vs-OFF2 drift bound available on demand.
#
# THE LAW THIS GATE ENCODES (the lane's law-shaped finding): acceptance sign follows
# (model x drafter x prompt), NOT the model. It INVERTED between the GGUF's embedded MTP head
# and the production regime drafter on the same two models the same day (q27 -1.9pp bare /
# +0.45pp regime; q9 +1.6pp bare / -3.05pp regime, worst cell -9.5pp). Therefore every cell
# here attaches the artifact's REAL PRODUCTION DRAFTER via MEMRA_MODELS "+draft" (which replaces
# the embedded head at load, worker.rs load_draft) and runs through the SERVER, not run-spec. A
# bare-head acceptance number is not evidence about a served config, so this gate does not
# collect one.
#
# CELLS: tools/fast-gate/accept-cells.tsv (registry, same shape as fast-gate/models.tsv).
# REFS:  tools/fast-gate/accept-refs/<cell>.ref  (counts + config fingerprint + text sha256)
#        tools/fast-gate/accept-refs/<cell>.text (the full pinned completion, for diffing)
# Two files per cell mirrors the goldens/<id>.tokens + <id>.perf convention.
#
# ---- --pin: THE SILENT-RE-PIN TRAP, CLOSED ----
# The receipted failure mode is not "someone forgot to run the gate". It is: run the kernel
# change, watch the battery go green, refresh the references, commit. The reference now encodes
# the regression and the gate defends it forever. `--pin` therefore REFUSES to run when
# crates/ is dirty (staged or unstaged) — references may only be minted from committed engine
# code, so every reference is attributable to a SHA someone can review. There is NO --force
# override for the crates/ check: an escape hatch on this specific check is the entire bug.
# (Dirt outside crates/ — docs, research/, tools/ — is fine and is only reported.)
# `--pin` also refuses to run when MEMRA_MMQ_F8F4 or another arm env is set, because pinning an
# opt-in arm's numbers as the default reference is the same trap wearing a different hat.
#
# ---- TEETH ----
# A gate only ever observed PASSING proves nothing. `--teeth` sets MEMRA_MMQ_F8F4=1 — the
# merged opt-in arm that provably moves q27's p1 cell (drafted 126->129, rounds 42->43, text
# sha fddd...->33d6...) — and INVERTS the verdict: the run MUST FAIL. If a known-moving arm
# still passes, this gate is not measuring acceptance and its green is worthless.
#
# NOT flock-wrapped: callers own the GPU lock (fast-gate's lockrun, local-ci's window
# discipline) — self-locking here would self-deadlock under fast-gate. Standalone runs should
# be wrapped: flock /tmp/memra-5090.lock tools/accept-gate.sh
#
# SKIPs cleanly (exit 0 + a "accept-gate: SKIP" line, fast-gate's verdict-word contract) when a
# model or drafter artifact is absent.
