# serve-stress-gate — c=64 concurrency robustness gate (lane/serving-density, 2026-08-06).
#
# THE SHAPE: 64 clients x short requests (128-256 generated tokens), staggered arrival,
# streaming — the robustness cell mistral.rs died on (6/69 finished at 64 clients). memra's
# serving battery had never proven the tick loop past c=8/16; this gate pins the contract:
#
#   1. ALL requests complete: HTTP 200, no hangs (per-request timeout), no drops.
#   2. Every stream is WELL-FORMED: >=1 data: chunk, a finish_reason in the final delta,
#      and the data: [DONE] terminator.
#   3. The worker survives: server process alive after the burst, and the server log
#      carries no panic / CUDA_ERROR / out-of-memory line (failure causes are quoted,
#      never inferred — the log IS the receipt).
#   4. p50/p95 completion wall time + TTFB recorded per run (INFORMATIONAL, not asserted —
#      this is a robustness gate, not a perf cell; perf lives in the tracked boards).
#
# Concurrency mechanics under test: MEMRA_MAX_SESSIONS default (64) lets the COUNT axis admit
# everything, so the VRAM axis is what has to hold. The admission gate (worker.rs: spec-capable
# models wait while free < cost + SPEC_SHRINK_RESERVE), the step-OOM park-requeue, and the F5
# right-size ladder are exactly the seams a 64-client burst stresses on a 24GB card (64 x
# ~286MiB live q9 spec sessions + 5.8GiB weights + a ~1.3GiB burst transient does NOT all fit
# — the gate proves the admission wait paces gracefully instead of OOMing or hanging).
#
# NOT flock-wrapped: callers own the GPU lock (fast-gate's lockrun / local-ci's window
# discipline) — self-locking here would self-deadlock under fast-gate.
#
# TEETH (--teeth, lane/admit-oom 2026-08-06): a gate only ever observed PASSING proves nothing.
# --teeth forces the admission transient reserve tiny (MEMRA_ADMIT_RESERVE_MB=16, i.e. back to
# roughly the pre-fix `2x cost` headroom) and INVERTS the verdict: the run must FAIL. If a
# deliberately-broken reserve still passes, this gate is not measuring the admission cost model
# and its green is worthless. Run it whenever the admission math changes.
#
# Usage: tools/serve-stress-gate.sh [--teeth] [model.gguf [draft.gguf [n_clients]]]
# Exits nonzero on any failed assertion. SKIPs (exit 0, "serve-stress-gate: SKIP" line —
# fast-gate's verdict-word contract) when the model artifact is absent.
