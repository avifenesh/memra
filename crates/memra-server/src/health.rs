//! Inference liveness (G5) + GPU-fault detection (G24) — lane/serve-hardening, 2026-08-06.
//!
//! THE GAP THIS CLOSES (provider table-stakes audit §3 G5, G24). `/health` used to answer
//! `{"status":"ok"}` off the AXUM task — i.e. it proved the HTTP listener was alive and
//! nothing else. The GPU worker is ONE `std::thread` owning the CUDA context; if it panicked
//! or the card wedged, HTTP kept answering 200 while every request blocked or errored on a
//! dead channel. That is the exact shape OpenRouter's uptime ladder punishes hardest: a green
//! health check in front of a box answering nothing (`<80%` uptime = fallback-only routing).
//!
//! THE MECHANISM: the worker's scheduler loop stamps a monotonic HEARTBEAT every iteration,
//! together with a PHASE (loading / idle / busy / dead). `/health` is then inference liveness:
//!
//!   * `PHASE_IDLE` — the worker is blocked on `rx.recv()` with no work at all. Staleness is
//!     MEANINGLESS here (an idle server legitimately stamps nothing for hours), so idle is
//!     unconditionally healthy. This distinction is load-bearing: a naive "beat age" check
//!     would report every quiet server as dead.
//!   * `PHASE_BUSY` — work is in flight, so the beat MUST advance. Age past the stall
//!     threshold = the worker is wedged (hung kernel, wedged card, deadlock) -> 503.
//!   * `PHASE_DEAD` / a recorded fault (worker panic, GPU fault) -> 503 immediately, no
//!     threshold wait.
//!
//! THE STALL THRESHOLD (`MEMRA_HEALTH_STALL_S`, default 120 s) must cover the longest
//! LEGITIMATE single iteration, which is a max-context prefill tick, not a decode step:
//! a naked lone fresh interactive request may prime up to 8192 tokens in one call, while
//! concurrent sessions remain capped at `PREFILL_TICK_T` (1024) tokens apiece and loop over
//! every active session inside ONE iteration. At the interactive cap
//! (`MEMRA_MAX_SESSIONS` = 64) that is 64 x 1024 = 65,536 primed tokens in a single loop pass;
//! at memra's measured 4k-prefill rate on this rig (1.2k tok/s — research/memra-vs-llama-daily-
//! 20260805) that is ~55 s. 120 s is that worst case with ~2.2x margin, and it is the same
//! number `tools/serve-fleet.sh` already uses for `LOAD_GRACE` — so the app threshold, the
//! bash supervisor's grace, and the systemd `StartLimitIntervalSec` sizing in
//! `deploy/systemd/` are ONE number instead of three. `tick_max_ms` (published on /health)
//! is the live receipt: if a real deployment ever observes a legitimate tick near the
//! threshold, that is measured evidence to raise it, not a guess.
//!
//! READINESS vs LIVENESS (k8s deprecated `/healthz` at v1.16 for `/livez` + `/readyz`;
//! KServe/Triton's Open Inference Protocol v2 is the inference-specific form). Split, per
//! that doctrine:
//!   * `/health` == `/livez` — "should this process be RESTARTED?" Draining is NOT a liveness
//!     failure (the process is exiting on its own; restarting it mid-drain kills in-flight
//!     work), so drain keeps answering 200 with `status:"draining"`.
//!   * `/readyz` — "should traffic be ROUTED here?" 503 while loading, draining, faulted, or
//!     stalled. This is ahead of vLLM (whose `/health` 503s only on `EngineDeadError`, with no
//!     readiness endpoint at all) and TGI (single `/health`).
//!
//! G24 — the GPU-fault watcher lives here too because it feeds the SAME unhealthy flag. Its
//! one hard design constraint: the worst Blackwell wedge class (Xid 119/120, GSP RPC timeout)
//! emits no error to the process AND HANGS THE QUERY TOOLS. So the watcher runs on its own
//! thread, spawns `nvidia-smi` as a CHILD with a hard timeout, and treats its own timeout as
//! the alarm — the health handler only ever reads an atomic, so a hung probe can never block
//! health reporting.
