//! Dead-darklane background jobs — valley detection + a yield-first job runner
//! (lane/darklane-training, 2026-08-07).
//!
//! THE THESIS (owner, standing): idle serve capacity carries owner research/training jobs,
//! yielding instantly to paying traffic. This module is the ENGINE half only: when the box
//! is idle, what runs, and how it gets out of the way. Scheduling policy and economics
//! (which jobs, what they're worth, when a valley is "worth" filling) belong to the product
//! repo — the seam is `MEMRA_BG_JOB` + the checkpoint protocol below.
//!
//! VALLEY DETECTION reuses worker truth that already exists instead of inventing a new
//! sensor: the scheduler flips `health` to `PHASE_IDLE` exactly when `active.is_empty() &&
//! queue.is_empty()` (worker.rs loop top) and `set_phase` stamps the beat on entry — so
//! `phase == IDLE` + `beat_age_ms` IS the idle duration, to the millisecond, with zero new
//! hot-path cost. `PENDING_ADMITS` closes the HTTP→worker handoff gap (a request the handler
//! has submitted but the worker hasn't popped yet is traffic, not idleness).
//!
//! THE LANE CLASS: below EVERY serving lane. Harvest is still a *request* class the engine
//! admits and schedules; a background job is not a request at all — it runs only while the
//! engine has NOTHING (no interactive, no judge, no harvest, no queue) and yields on the
//! first sign of any of them. Asymmetric hysteresis on purpose: yield fires on the busy
//! EDGE (any activity, no debounce — paying traffic never waits for a threshold), resume
//! waits for a full `MEMRA_VALLEY_S` of quiet (a between-requests gap in an active
//! conversation is not a valley).
//!
//! YIELD MECHANISM v1 — simplest honest first: the job is a CHILD PROCESS in its own
//! process group; yield is SIGSTOP to the group, resume is SIGCONT. Bounded by the poll
//! interval (`MEMRA_BG_POLL_MS`, default 25 ms) + signal delivery — measured receipts in
//! `research/darktrain-20260807/`. Two consequences the operator must know:
//!   * a SIGSTOPPED process KEEPS its memory — VRAM included. The VRAM budget below is
//!     therefore carved out for the LIFE of the job, not per-valley.
//!   * SIGSTOP is only cheap for jobs whose working set can sit cold. GPU-resident training
//!     that can't sit on stopped VRAM uses checkpoint mode instead.
//!
//! CHECKPOINT PROTOCOL v1 (`MEMRA_BG_YIELD_MODE=checkpoint`) — the seam for training-class
//! jobs. The "checkpoint callback" is process-level: SIGUSR1 to the job's group means
//! "checkpoint NOW and exit"; the job writes its state to disk and exits **75**
//! (EX_TEMPFAIL, the sysexits convention for "transient — retry me"). The runner relaunches
//! the SAME command in the next valley and the job resumes from its own checkpoint file.
//! Exit 0 = complete (never relaunched); any other exit = failed (never relaunched, loud).
//! A job that outlives `MEMRA_BG_CKPT_GRACE_MS` after SIGUSR1 is SIGKILLed — the yield
//! bound holds even against a wedged job, and the on-disk checkpoint is whatever it last
//! wrote (at-least-once semantics: a training step may repeat, never be lost). Toy proof:
//! `tools/bg-ckpt-counter.py`. An in-process trainer API can replace this seam later
//! without changing the valley/scheduler half.
//!
//! GPU MEMORY DISCIPLINE: the job gets a VRAM budget (`MEMRA_BG_VRAM_MB`, default 0 =
//! CPU-only) from the serve headroom and is REFUSED at launch if it doesn't fit:
//! launch requires `min free across visible GPUs >= budget + serve headroom`, where the
//! headroom term composes with the existing `MEMRA_MOE_RESIDENT_HEADROOM_GB` pattern
//! (default 2.0 GB — the same class of reserve the resident planner keeps beside weights).
//! Fail-closed: a budget > 0 with no readable `nvidia-smi` is a refusal, not a shrug. The
//! runner enforces fit at launch; staying inside the budget at runtime is the job's
//! contract (documented in FLAGS.md) — v1 has no cgroup-style VRAM enforcement.
