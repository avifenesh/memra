# Third-party notices — memra-engine

Some CUDA kernels under `cu/` are hand-ports ("vendored" per the mmq playbook — see each
file's header) of kernels from llama.cpp's ggml-cuda backend
(https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp, snapshot c818263f2), restructured to be
ggml-decoupled and self-contained. Affected translation units:

- `cu/mmq_q8_0.cu`, `cu/mmq_q4_0.cu`, `cu/mmq_q45k.cu`, `cu/mmq_iq_experts.cu`,
  `cu/mmq_fp4.cu`, `cu/mmq_nvfp4_w4a8.cu`, `cu/mmq_nvfp4_f8f4.cu`, `cu/mmq_fp8_blk.cu`
  (mul_mat_q tile/MMA structure)
- `cu/fattn_vendor.cu` (flash_attn_ext MMA-f16 structure)
