//! EDGE-1 §B: SLRU GPU expert-residency cache (MOE-SLRU-PLAN §B).
//!
//! Stage-1 `moe_ffn` re-stages EVERY routed expert EVERY token over PCIe into one scratch slot.
//! The same ~15-20% of experts recur (the "hot expert" mass), so an SLRU residency cache makes
//! the steady-state re-stage count -> ~0. The cache holds N fixed-address GPU slots (never
//! re-allocated, never fragmented), a `BlockId -> slot` residency table, an SLRU eviction policy
//! (probation + protected segments; the second-miss "ghost" admission filter was measured a net
//! loss in both regimes and removed 2026-07-08 — first-miss admit is the policy) so a one-off cold
//! expert can never evict a genuinely hot one.
//!
//! THE bit-identity property (MOE-SLRU-PLAN §B.3): a cache HIT and a MISS feed `qmatvec_view` the
//! *same* block bytes — the only difference is whether the `memcpy_htod` ran. So the cache-hit
//! weight path is byte-for-byte identical to stage-every-token. TWO gates pin this, and they
//! cover different classes: `src/bin/kernel_check.rs` `d2-cache-bit-identity` pins ONE block of a
//! real GGUF checkpoint (dtypes `IQ3_S | IQ4_XS | Q6_K | Q8_0` — everything else, NVFP4 included,
//! takes its `cells.skip` arm), and `tests/glm5_moe_residency_gpu.rs` pins it END TO END on a
//! glm5_next fixture for the safetensors NVFP4 macro-carrying class, in CI, without a checkpoint.
//!
//! QUANT-FORMAT AGNOSTIC, and that is load-bearing for the safetensors NVFP4 class (glm5_next /
//! GLM-5.3-Flash, Step-3.7-Flash-NVFP4, the unsloth 35B-A3B ST class). A slot is `max_block_bytes`
//! of opaque bytes keyed by `BlockId`; nothing here reads a qtype, a block stride, or a scale.
//! The loader has already repacked modelopt NVFP4 (`weight` + per-16 `weight_scale`) into ONE
//! contiguous per-expert block in memra's internal `block_nvfp4` layout
//! (`nvfp4_repack::repack_modelopt_to_gguf`, `row_bytes = in_f / 64 * 36`), so an NVFP4 block is
//! staged and hit exactly like a k-quant GGUF block. The per-expert `weight_scale_2` MACRO scale
//! is NOT in the block — it rides `HostExps::macros` and is folded post-matmul by the MoE forward
//! — so residency can never move it, and hit/miss stay bit-identical for macro-carrying banks too.
//!
//! Gated behind `MEMRA_MOE_CACHE`, **default ON since 2026-07-08** (`docs/FLAGS.md`: the row is
//! spelled `MEMRA_MOE_CACHE=0` = stage-every-token, i.e. `=0` is the ROLLBACK, not the default).
//! `Engine::moe_cache_enabled()` is `var("MEMRA_MOE_CACHE") != Ok("0")`. This line previously read
//! "default off => current stage-every-token behavior", which was the pre-2026-07-08 state and had
//! been stale for seven weeks; it was corrected in the glm53-flash bring-up lane (2026-08-28) after
//! it was quoted as the live default in a placement plan.
