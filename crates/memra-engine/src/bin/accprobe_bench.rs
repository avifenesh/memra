//! accprobe-bench — THE Q1 MEASUREMENT of the FP8-ST v3 gate (lane/fp8-v3-gate, 2026-08-05).
//!
//! PRICES ONE CLAIM. research/fp8st-20260804/mmq-v2/LANE-VERDICT.jsonl §3 ends its ceiling analysis
//! with: "What is left is the f32 accumulator itself against the floor's s32, and that is structural
//! to per-block FP8 as formulated." §6 then makes it a gate: a v3 (quantize the e4m3 mantissa into an
//! int8-compatible product per 128-block so the chain accumulates in s32) "should not start without a
//! receipted estimate that s32-vs-f32 accumulate is worth the >= 10pp it would have to buy."
//!
//! THE INSTRUMENT (cu/mmq_q8_0_f32acc.cu): the Q8_0 MMQ FLOOR kernel with the accumulator as its ONE
//! free variable. Arm S32 is the floor's `mma.sync.aligned.m16n8k32.row.col.s32.s8.s8.s32`; arm F32
//! is the SAME m16n8k32 shape with the SAME A (4x b32) / B (2x b32) / D (4-reg) fragment ABI running
//! `mma.sync.aligned.kind::f8f6f4.m16n8k32.row.col.f32.e4m3.e4m3.f32` — the exact op v2 accumulates
//! in. Same tiles, same smem, same loaders, same launch config, same fold count, same device
//! buffers. So `ratio = t_f32 / t_s32` is the accumulator's cost on this silicon, and
//! `delta_pp = 100 * (ratio - 1)` is an UPPER BOUND on what a v3's s32 conversion could recover
//! (a v3 would additionally pay per-128-block mantissa extraction).
//!
//! WHY MEASURE IT ON THE FLOOR AND NOT ON v2's KERNEL: v2 already chains four k32 MMAs into one
//! accumulator and folds ONCE per 128-k block, where the floor folds every k32 — so v2's epilogue
//! f32 work is already strictly cheaper than the floor's and cannot be the residual gap. Swapping
//! the accumulator inside the floor holds tiles, traffic, occupancy and fold count fixed and moves
//! only the named variable. Building an s32 v2 instead would change the arithmetic contract, need a
//! new host reference, and be the v3 this gate is deciding whether to fund.
//!
//! GEMM-ONLY AND QUANTIZER-FREE: both arms consume the SAME pre-quantized block_q8_1_mmq activation
//! buffer, synthesized here once per shape. Two reasons it is synthesized rather than produced by a
//! device quantizer: (1) the accumulator lives in the GEMM, so a quantizer inside the timed region
//! would dilute exactly the quantity being measured; (2) an int8 quantizer emits +-127 at every block
//! amax, and 0x7F is the e4m3 NaN code — the F32 arm would then run on NaNs and could take a
//! different path than the S32 arm, making it not the same experiment. The synthesized bytes are
//! therefore restricted to magnitudes <= 126, i.e. finite and non-NaN in BOTH readings, and both arms
//! read the identical bytes.
//!
//! NEITHER ARM'S OUTPUT IS A NUMERIC CLAIM. The two arms compute different arithmetic on the same
//! bytes by construction (int8 products vs e4m3 products); this bin measures TIME only. Exactness for
//! the real kernels is owned by fp8-mmq-check / kernel-check.
//!
//! PROTOCOL (evidence discipline): warm up both arms, then reps x (F32 timed, S32 timed) INTERLEAVED
//! inside the rep loop so both share one clock/thermal regime; median of reps; run under
//! flock /tmp/memra-5090.lock. Temps are recorded by the caller's telemetry, not here.
//!
//! usage: accprobe-bench [m] [reps] [27b|1p7b]        (default m=512, reps=9, 27b)
