//! FP8-ACT PREFILL (MEMRA_PP_FP8=1): cuBLASLt FP8-E4M3 TN GEMM for the F8-E4M3-origin projections.
//!
//! Probe verdict 2026-07-08 (probe/fp8_lt_prefill.cu, JSONL row in research/tune-data): cuBLASLt
//! FP8 GEMM runs 620-795 TF at the 27B prefill shapes vs 47-72 TF for the qmatvec_gemm_q8_0 class
//! those weights ride today (46.5% of pp GPU time) — projected ~1.85x pp from the F8-native
//! layers alone. The weight side is EXACT: the checkpoint's raw e4m3 bytes + per-tensor f32
//! weight_scale are stashed at load next to the Q8_0 re-encode (`GpuTensor::Quant { fp8 }`,
//! following the `cutlass` optional-operand precedent). The only new rounding vs today is the
//! ACTIVATION: f32 -> e4m3 with ONE per-batch scalar scale (amax/448) instead of q8_1's per-32
//! int8 — finer mantissa lost, coarser scale granularity; the run-gen argmax gate arbitrates.
//!
//! Dispatch: `matmul`/`matmul_pre` m>=16 arms ONLY (prefill). Decode (m<16) keeps the Q8_0
//! dp4a/MMVQ chain bit-for-bit — the spec-exactness law is untouched, and the m=K+1 verify tier
//! (m<=9) never reaches this path.
//!
//! All device work (amax reduce, scale finalize, e4m3 quantize, cublasLtMatmul) runs on the one
//! `gpu.stream` inside a single C-ABI call (cu/fp8_prefill.cu) — no host sync anywhere: the act
//! scale is folded with weight_scale into a device scalar fed to the GEMM's B_SCALE_POINTER
//! (per-token OUTER_VEC B-scales are NOT supported on sm_120 — probed; scalar scales verified
//! exact there).
