# Contributing to memra

Issues welcome anytime. PRs welcome **only when they carry proof**, per the rules below: CI is compile-only (no GPU runners on either target arch), so a human reviewer is the only gate between claim and merged code. Unproven PRs (no gates run, no numbers, "should be faster", AI-generated diffs with no on-device verification) will be closed, not debated. This is not gatekeeping: every accepted kernel becomes load-bearing in a correctness contract (see [Testing](docs/TESTING.md)), and reverting a bad merge costs far more than rejecting an unproven one.

## Before you write code

1. Read [`research/tune-data/*.jsonl`](research/tune-data/) for your target kernel/model. Labeled corpus of *every* prior tuning attempt, wins and losses both. If your idea was already tried and rejected, the record says why. Re-proposing a measured loss without new evidence is spam.
2. Read [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md) for the sm_120a hardware ledger: several plausible optimizations (e.g. NVFP4 grouped/MoE GEMM, sm_90/sm_100 kernel ports) are already known infeasible on this silicon; check before spending effort.
3. Have access to a development GPU: sm_120a Blackwell for the main lane, or an H100 (sm_90a) for Hopper-lane changes. Its evidence ledger is [`ARCHITECTURE-H100.md`](ARCHITECTURE-H100.md). Main-lane work can iterate on RTX 50-series hardware, but its final pre-merge/pre-tag battery runs on a designated non-serving 2x RTX PRO 6000 pair, the rented `box1` pair carries it today ([`research/coldfix-20260812/PROGRESS.md`](research/coldfix-20260812/PROGRESS.md)). If you cannot produce the development evidence, open an issue describing the idea instead of a PR; the final verification receipt may be supplied by a maintainer with access to the box.

## Required proof, in order

Every PR touching a kernel, forward pass, dispatch policy, or anything on the decode/prefill hot
path must include, in the PR description, evidence for **all** of the following. A PR missing any
one of these is incomplete, not "mostly done": do not open it yet.

### 1. Correctness gates (all three, all green)

```bash
tools/local-ci.sh                      # one command: kernel-check + prime-gate + argmax gate + VERIFY-GATE
                                       # + spec self-consistency + decode-batch-gate + graph-warmup stress + serve-smoke
```

or individually:

```bash
./target/release/kernel-check          # every quant kernel vs a CPU reference
./target/release/run-gen  ...          # prefill argmax MUST match decode argmax; the
                                       # batched-prime line (#46) must not be MISMATCH-STRUCTURED
./target/release/run-spec ...          # K=1..8 self-consistency: every K token-identical to plain decode
```

run-gen prints a second gate line on text prompts >= 16 tokens: `batched-prime argmax=...`
compares `prime_cache` (the config that seeds real generation and serving) against the
tokenwise reference. `FLIP-NEARTIE` there is the documented cross-config drift class
(reported, non-fatal); `MISMATCH-STRUCTURED` fails the run. Multi-prompt battery:
`./target/release/prime-gate <model.gguf> --prompts-file <f> [--chat]`.

Paste actual pass/fail output (or relevant tail), not "gates pass." A kernel that reduces in different floating-point order can flip an argmax at tight logit margins, which has silently broken "faster" kernels before (`research/tune-data/`), so a green run *right now, on your branch* is required, not an assumption.

Changes touching the Hopper (sm_90a) lane build from source (`MEMRA_CUDA_ARCH=90a`) and run its
gates directly on an H100 — kernel-check config pins (incl. the
KQRP, f16-mirror, f16g-sk, and batched-seqs pins), decode-batch (config + strict, gates 1–3 incl.
gate3c lean-logits), decode-dc, graph-decode, and graph-session. (These lived in the
`tools/validate-h100.sh` one-command battery until it was retired with the Hopper CI lane on
2026-09-02.) `ALL GATES GREEN` output
pasted, same rule as above. Gate1's config-mode verdict is the multi-seed fraction rule
(#47): FAIL iff >= 4 of 6 `MEMRA_GATE_SEED` draws diverge before step 3 (near-tie seeds
are legal FP dice, plumbing fails every draw); `MEMRA_GATE_CANARY=1` is the teeth check
when recalibrating.

### 1b. Perf regression battery (local CI)

```bash
tools/local-ci.sh --perf               # full cell battery (~15 min); --perf-quick = 31B subset
```

This is the drift detector correctness gates cannot be: it re-measures every published
model cell (plain AND spec, short AND depth) and, critically, records **speculative
acceptance and tokens/round** per spec cell, verdicting each against the rolling median of
its last 5 rows (`research/tune-data/perf-ci.jsonl`). FAIL = >3% tok/s drop or >0.05
acceptance drop. Acceptance drift is invisible to every exactness gate (decode and verify
shift *together*, bit-consistently) and silently cost this repo half its 31B short-spec
margin across ~40 green-gated commits in July 2026, hence the battery. Cells whose model
files are absent on your machine skip cleanly; set `MEMRA_MODELS_DIR` to your model root.
The pre-push hook requires a battery row newer than your newest engine-touching commit
(warn-only on machines without models; `MEMRA_SKIP_PERF_CI=1` overrides: say why in the PR).

### 2. Performance: prefill AND decode, both, never just one

A kernel that helps decode and quietly regresses prefill (or vice versa) is net loss, not win. Report both every time, even if your change nominally targets only one:

| Metric | Baseline (main) | Your branch | Ratio |
|---|---|---|---|
| pp512 (prefill, tok/s) | | | |
| pp2048 (prefill, tok/s) | | | |
| tg128 @ 512-ctx (decode, tok/s) | | | |

Use exact protocol in [`research/benchmarks.md`](research/benchmarks.md): **N≥3 medians**, `gpu-full-power on` verified beforehand, and baseline + branch measured **interleaved in same session** (sequential cross-session runs drift up to ~10% from clock/thermal state, same-session-only number is not evidence).

### 3. Main runners exercised, not just the micro-kernel

Benchmark binaries alone (`decode-bench`, `mvq-msweep`) prove a kernel is fast in isolation; they do not prove the engine still works. Every PR must also show clean run through actual model-serving paths your change touches:

- `run-gen`: end-to-end generation on at least one real model (not a synthetic/random-weight
  smoke test), full output shown, prefill/decode argmax line included.
- `run-spec`: if your change touches anything upstream of speculative decoding's target forward
  (attention, GEMM, MoE dispatch, KV cache), run this too, not just `run-gen`.
- `memra-server`: if your change touches request handling, batching, or anything server-side, one
  real request/response through the OpenAI-compatible endpoint.

"It compiles and the unit-level gate passed" is not evidence the runners still produce sane
output end to end: show them running.

## What gets a PR closed on sight

- No before/after numbers, or numbers from a different session without the interleaved-protocol
  disclosure above.
- Only one of {prefill, decode} measured when the change plausibly touches both.
- Correctness gates claimed "passing" with no pasted output.
- AI-generated kernel/algorithm changes with no evidence they were run on real sm_120a hardware.
- Portability changes (targeting sm_89, sm_90, datacenter Blackwell, etc.) without first reading
  [Installation](docs/INSTALLATION.md), [Models and hardware](docs/MODELS.md), and [Scope](#scope) below: this is a single-target engine,
  not a general runtime.
- Drive-by style-only diffs bundled with unrelated functional changes: split them.

## Scope

This is a from-scratch engine hard-tuned for Blackwell sm_120a across two hardware classes:
RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell pairs for verification, final tuning, and serving (including PP-2),
and RTX 50-series for development and single-card tuning. H100 SXM remains the separately
compile-gated sm_90a lane. Existing 5090 boards remain 5090 receipts; they are not relabeled
as target-pair measurements. See [`docs/PERFORMANCE.md` §Rigs](docs/PERFORMANCE.md#rigs--what-was-measured-on-what)
and
[Installation](docs/INSTALLATION.md) and [Models and hardware](docs/MODELS.md) before proposing portability work: other GPUs compile
via the portable arch (`MEMRA_CUDA_ARCH=89` builds the Ada correctness-first eval lane) but
are untuned, and tuning choices throughout the codebase assume these two Blackwell classes
or the separately gated Hopper lane.

## Validation reports from your rig are the easiest contribution

memra is hard-tuned on RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell pairs and the RTX 5090 Laptop, and reports from
**every end-user rig** are wanted. Filing a
[hardware validation report](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/hardware-validation.md) is genuinely
useful even if you never touch the code:

- **Desktop 50-series (5090/5080/5070 Ti/5070):** the 5090 is the development and
  single-card-tuning rig with a tracked regression board. The other cards share sm_120 but
  have different SM-count/bandwidth ratios; a perf battery
  (`MEMRA_MODELS_DIR=... tools/local-ci.sh --perf`) plus an interleaved pairing (protocol:
  [`research/benchmarks.md`](research/benchmarks.md)) is the evidence that moves them from
  "should work" to "supported".
- **Older NVIDIA (Ada/Ampere):** the main build targets sm_120a; `MEMRA_CUDA_ARCH=89` builds
  the in-tree Ada eval lane. "What breaks where" reports map the compatibility floor,
  correctness output alone advances the story.

## Where to look first

|---|---|
| `memra-engine` | CUDA kernels (`cu/`), forward passes, speculative decoding, MoE cache, graph decode |
| `memra-gguf` | GGUF parser + tensor loading (memory-mapped) |
| `memra-tokenizer` | BPE tokenizer + chat templates from GGUF metadata |
| `memra-runtime` | CUDA device/stream/memory primitives over cudarc |
| `memra-kv` | KV cache + format policy behind the KvDev device seam |
| `memra-sampling` | Host sampler + device Philox sampling behind one trait |
| `memra-validate` | Gate harness: tolerance policy, deterministic vectors, N-median runner |
| `memra-server` | OpenAI-compatible HTTP server (axum): batched decode, prefill batching, KV reuse |
| `memra-probe` | Standalone hardware microbenches |

- [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md): hard hardware constraints and the sm_120a feasibility ledger.
- [`docs/DRAFT-REGIME.md`](docs/DRAFT-REGIME.md): the standard drafter pipeline (own-gen ranks → byte-verbatim extraction → trim/quantize, adopt on e2e only). Any PR touching drafts, trims, or acceptance follows it: its three laws were each violated at measured cost before being written down.
- [`docs/decisions/`](docs/decisions/): design decision records.
- [`research/benchmarks.md`](research/benchmarks.md): the exact A/B measurement protocol referenced above.
- [`research/tune-data/`](research/tune-data/): labeled corpus of tuning experiments (config → measured result, wins and losses both). Check before re-trying something already measured.
